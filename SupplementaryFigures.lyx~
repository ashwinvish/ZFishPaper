.
 Briefly, correlations for every pixel over a 5min acquisition period was
 determined for eye position and eye velocity.
 A region-of-Interest (ROI) was then drawn over the pixels where the majority
 were correlated one of these variables.
 The fluorescence was reported as change in fluorescence for each frame
 to the average fluorescence, divided by the average.
 Saccadic fluorescence traces were displayed over an 8 sec window starting
 1 sec before the end of the saccade.
 The firing rates were computed over a 6 second fixation period beginning
 1 sec after the end of the saccade.
 The firing rates were computed by deconvolving the average fluorescent
 traces with a calcium impulse response function (CIRF) as described previously

.Briefly, it was stained in 1% reduced osmium tetroxide with potassium ferrocyani
de for 2 hr on ice.
 It was then washed 4x 30 min with 0.1M cacodylate buffer, also on ice.
 This was then followed by amplification in 1% sodium thiocarbohydroazide
 (TCH) for 15min followed by 3x5 min washes in water and another incubation
 in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr.
 The tissue was then washed 3x15 min in water and incubated with 1% aqueous
 uranyl acetate overnight.
 The following day the tissue was washed 3x15 min in water and dehydrated
 with a series of ethanol, followed by propylene oxide (PO).
 The tissue was then infiltrated in decreasing gradients of PO and EPON
 for 24 hrs and baked for 48 hrs at 60 C.
 The EPON based resin was tailored to have low viscosity, to help with better
 infiltration for this tissue.
 Following hardening, the tissue block face was coarsely trimmed and a rectangul
ar mesa was defined for serial sectioning.
 Care was taken to orient the specimen to permit sectioning along the horizontal
 axis.
 Serial sections from the above animal were collected approximately from
 the level of the Mauthner cell at a thickness of 45 nm.
 .
 The serial sections were then adhered to a silicon wafer, using double
 sided carbon tape (TEDpella), the wafers were coated with a thin film of
 carbon to make them conductive.

 Briefly, individual images were imported into the TrakEM2 framework and
 montaged, first, using affine transforms, followed by elastic transforms.
 The images were then registered using a similar approach, where the first
 pass was performed using affine transforms, followed by elastic transforms

 All the alignment was performed on a machine with 32 virtual cores and
 120GB RAM.

\begin_layout Standard
To locate the cells that were involved in the integrator circuit, we made
 use of the fact that large, gross morphological features were easily identified
 in both the LM and EM stacks.
 Once enough such features were identified in the LM stack, we located these
 same landmarks in the high-res EM stack.
 Each pair of landmarks (one from the LM volume and one from the EM volume)
 was then used to calculate a global affine transform that was applied to
 transform the LM volume to be overlaid on the EM volume using the TrakEM2
 plugin in Fiji

 Following this registration, we were able to reliable locate the same cells
 from the LM and the EM volumes.

Reconstructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two expert tracers reconstructed the cells beginning from the cell bodies
 in an independent manner.
 During the tracing process, one of the expert tracers annotated all pre
 and postsynaptic sites for each cells.
 The skeletonized tree structure was exported from TrakEM2 as *.swc files.
 These trees were then imported into Matlab using custom scripts to import
 .swc files as trees.
 The traces of the two tracers were compared by a third reviewer.
 The third reviewer, independently reviewed points of disagreement and decided
 which points of disagreement were either over-reconstructed or were under-recon
structed.
 In some cases, the traces were re-visited by the tracers if it was needed.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All traces were exported as .swc files from TrakEM2.
 All tree lengths was reported as pathlengths unless noted otherwise.
 Similarly, all lengths to a pre- or post synaptic site was reported as
 pathlengths.
 We defined the axon initiation site was annotated as the parent node of
 the first presynaptic site.
 One cell from ipsi-only group was defined as an axon, based on diameter
 of the axons and the 'bare' initial segment.
 All neurites that were not axonal were defined as dendritic.
 All nodes of the tree were thus divided as axonal nodes or dendritic nodes.
 Pathlengths were then generated for a tree over all axonal nodes or all
 dendritic nodes, and the length of the tree was the sum of all axonal length
 and dendritic length.
 A collateral was defined as all those segments of an axon, that emerged
 from the central axonal tree.
 All tree nodes that were axonal were then divided as those that were part
 of a collateral and those that were not.
 Following this, pathlengths and numbers were calculated by treating those
 nodes like any other.
 The completeness of cells was decided based on the number of neurites that
 exited the cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diameter of the trees was generated by drawing a line segment across
 the cross-section of the tree at a random location along the tree.
 Many such line segments were drawn across the entire extent of the tree,
 where the tracer was blinded to the fact whether the neurite was an axon
 or a dendrite.
 The measurements were then separated as dendritic diameter or axonal diameter
 after all the trees were measured in this manner.
 The values were reported as a mean across all dendritic or axonal measures
 for a tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arbor densities of the dendrites was computed by projecting all the axonal
 or dendritic nodes along the desired plane and reported in a normalized
 scale.
 Arbor volumes were computed using the Matlab function

.
 To infer the neurotransmitter identity from the stripe organization of
 the cell bodies, we annotated the location of all the cell bodies from
 a low-resolution stack.
 The cell density was then computed by projecting all the cells along the
 desired axis.
 This process picked out the peaks that were visible in the EM images.
 The location of a stripe was defined as the local peak that emerged from
 the cell density projecting analysis.
 The planar organization of the postsynapses and presynapses were fit to
 a plane using the

 Reticulospinal cells were identified based on the ultrastructure, that
 was very different form the remaining cells in the area.
 These cells were rich in mitochondria and gave rise to a large myelinated
 axon that joined the remaining fibers along the midline.
 We fit a plane to the reticulospinal neurons, and identified a point on
 this plane that bisected Mi3 and Ca.
