Briefly, a stack was acquired over the same imaging window, with optical
 sections every 1.3 µm, and with a lateral resolution of 0.5 µm.
 Once this was performed, the animal was anesthetized and the skin over
 the hindbrain was removed, to facilitate penetration of the fixative, and
 the animal was immersed in fixative to preserve the ultrastructure.
 We found that the removal of the skin was important for good quality fixation.

The animal was immersed in a fixative of 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehy

 Then it was thoroughly washed in 0.1M cacodylate buffer before staining.
 The tissue was stained using a conventional ROTO procedure (

 the tissue was infiltrated with an LX-112 based EPON resin for 24 hrs and
 baked for 48 hrs at 60 C.
 The EPON based resin was tailored to have low viscosity, to help with better
 infiltration for this tissue.
 Following hardening, the tissue block face was coarsely trimmed and a rectangul
ar mesa was defined for serial sectioning.
 Care was taken to orient the specimen to permit sectioning along the horizontal
 axis.
 Serial sections from the above animal were collected approximately from
 the level of the Mauthner cell at a thickness of 45 nm.
 .
 The serial sections were then adhered to a silicon wafer, using double
 sided carbon tape (TEDpella), the wafers were coated with a thin film of
 carbon to make them conductive.
 Images were imported into the TrakEM2 framework and montaged, first, using
 affine transforms, followed by elastic transforms.
 The images were then registered using a similar approach, where the first
 pass was performed using affine transforms, followed by elastic transforms.
 All the alignment was performed on a machine with 32 cores and 120GB RAM.

 Once this was done, the animal was placed in an imaging setup that allowed

This paradigm allows for the correlation of eye movement behavior to the

 We performed the functional light microscopy at pre-defined planes close

Once functional imaging of the larva was performed, it was immediately prepared
 for electron microscopy by immersing in fixative.

 The sections were then made conductive, by evaporating a thin layer of
 carbon and imaged in a field emitting scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)
 to obtain an electron microscopy (EM) volume.
 Each section was imaged at a resolution of 5nm/pixel in a region of interest
 that roughly corresponded with area imaged on the light microscopic.
 The EM volume we imaged contained 15791 image tiles (8K x 8K pixels each)
 or

 pixels.
 These images were registered using the trakEM2 plugin in Fiji

 Briefly, individual images were first montaged using affine transforms
 followed by elastic transforms.
 Following this they were aligned in the z dimension, using first, affine
 and followed by elastic transforms.

To locate the cells that were involved in the integrator circuit, we first
 extracted the location of cells in the light microscopic volume that were
 eye-position sensitive.
 Once these cells were located in the light microscopic volume, we then
 needed to register the LM stack to the EM stack in order to locate the
 same cells in the EM volume.
 To do this, we made use of the fact that large, gross morphological features
 should be easy to spot in the EM stack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once enough such features were identified, we located these same landmarks
 in the high-res EM stack.
 Each pair of landmarks (one from the LM volume and one from the EM volume)
 was then used to calculate a global affine transform that was applied to
 transform the LM volume to be overlaid on the EM volume using the TrakEM2
 plugin in Fiji

 Following this registration, we were able to reliable locate the same cells
 from the LM and the EM volumes.

Two expert tracers reconstructed the cells beginning from the cell bodies
 in an independent manner.
 During the tracing process, one of the expert tracers annotated all pre
 and postsynaptic sites for each cells.
 The skeletonized tree structure was exported from TrakEM2 as *.swc files.
 These trees were then imported into Matlab using custom scripts to import
 .swc files as trees.
 The traces of the two tracers were compared by a third reviewer.
 The third reviewer, independently reviewed points of disagreement and decided
 which points of disagreement were either over-reconstructed or were under-recon
structed.
 In some cases, the traces were re-visited by the tracers if it was needed.

 All tree lengths was reported as pathlengths unless noted otherwise.
 Similarly, all lengths to a pre or post synaptic site was reported as pathlengt

 axon initiation site was annotated as the parent node of the first presynaptic
 site.
 For the putative-axons that originated at the soma, they were annotated
 as beginning from the root node.
 One cell from ipsi-only group
\change_inserted 78966105 1467917611
 was defined as an axon

, based on 
\change_inserted 78966105 1467917626
diameter
\change_unchanged
 of the axons and the 'bare' initial segment.
 All neurites that were not axonal were 
\change_inserted 78966105 1467917649
defiend as
\change_unchanged
 dendritic.
 All nodes of the tree were thus divided as axonal nodes or dendritic nodes.
 Pathlengths were then generated for a tree over all axonal nodes or all
 dendritic nodes, and the length of the tree was the sum of all axonal length
 and dendritic length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diameter of the trees was generated by drawing a line segment across
 the cross-section of the tree at a random location along the tree.
 Many such line segments were drawn across the entire extent of the tree,
 where the tracer was blinded to the fact whether the neurite was an axon
 or a dendrite.
 The measurements were then separated as dendritic diameter or axonal diameter
 after all the trees were measured in this manner.
 The values were reported as a mean across all dendritic or axonal measures
 for a tree.
 A collateral was defined as all those segments of an axon, that emerged
 from the central axonal tree.
 All tree nodes that were axonal were then divided as those that were part
 of a collateral and those that were not.
 Following this, pathlengths and numbers were calculated by treating those
 nodes like any other.
 The completeness of cells was decided based on the number of neurites that
 exited the cells.

Arbor densities of the dendrites was computed by projecting all the axonal
 or dendritic nodes along the desired plane and reported in a normalized
 scale.
 Arbor volumes were computed using the Matlab function

 To infer the neurotransmitter identity from the stripe organization of
 the cell bodies, we annotated the location of all the cell bodies from
 a low-resolution stack.
 The cell density was then computed by projecting all the cells along the
 desired axis.
 This process picked out the peaks that were visible in the EM images.
 The location of a stripe was defined as the local peak that emerged from
 the cell density projecting analysis.
