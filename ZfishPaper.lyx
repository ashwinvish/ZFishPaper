\begin_layout Abstract
For the eyes to remain still between saccades, there exists cells in the
 hindbrain that fire in a persistent manner for the duration of the gaze.
 These cells perform the task of integration, in that their inputs are eye
 velocity signals and their output is eye position signals.
 How these cells perform this task is the focus of the study.
 To study this circuit we used two-photon microscopy in combination with
 serial electron microscopy to map the function of velocity-to-position-integrat
or (VPNI) neurons in the hindbrain of larval zebrafish onto the ultrastructure
 of the same neurons.
 Hindbrain neurons of larval zebrafish were imaged while the animal made
 spontaneous saccades.
 The same neurons were then identified and reconstructed at the ultrastructure
 level.
 Our reconstructions revealed VPNI cells with varied dendritic morphologies,
 axonal projections and synaptic distributions, over a large range of persistenc
e time constants.
 We observed that cells located rostrally had ipsilaterally projecting axons
 while cells that were caudal had contralaterally projecting axons.
 We also observe, the first evidence of synapses among integrator neurons,
 specifically from the ipsilaterally projecting cells onto other ipsilateral
 cells and from ipsilaterally projecting cells onto contralateral cells.
 The axons of these cells tend to have 'clustered` presynaptic sites onto
 dendrites from different cells.
 The neurotransmitter identity of these VPNI cells can be inferred by somatic
 locations of cells that are known to follow a stereotypic expression pattern
 in larval zebrafish.
 Based on this, we speculate that cells with ipsilaterally projecting axons
 were largely excitatory, where as cells with contralaterally projecting
 axons were inhibitory.
 Together, these observations are beginning to reveal the structure of the
 circuit that can support neural integration in the larval zebrafish.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
A promising approach for relating physiology and anatomy of neural circuits
 is to perform two-photon calcium imaging of neural activity in the living
 brain, followed by serial electron microscopy of the same brain.
 This has been carried out successfully for the mouse retina (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) and primary visual cortex (

).
 Here we report the application of this approach to a population of neurons
 defined by their encoding of behavioral variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We studied the population of premotor neurons defined by their encoding
 of eye position.
 This population makes up the neural circuit known as the "velocity-to-position
 neural integrator," or "neural integrator" for short (

 In fish (

), rodents (), non-human primates (

LatexCommand citet
key "Robinson:1975vm,Robinson:1989wt"

\end_inset

), and humans (cite), the neural integrator is the "final common pathway"
 for all types of eye movements.
 This neural circuit performs the computational operation of integration
 with respect to time.
 The mechanisms supporting temporal integration remain unclear even after
 decades of research (cite).
 Many hypotheses and models have been proposed, and a number of them invoke
 circuit mechanisms (

\begin_layout Standard
Integrator neurons were identified in the hindbrain of the larval zebrafish
 using two-photon calcium imaging while recording spontaneous eye movements.
 The same region of the hindbrain was then imaged via serial section electron
 microscopy (EM).
 Analysis of the calcium data identified 22 integrator neurons, defined
 by neural activities that were highly correlated with eye position.
 The same neurons were located in the EM dataset, and their neurites were
 completely reconstructed within the confines of the imaged volume.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For comparison, a total of 3004 cell bodies were identified in the imaged
 volume, and 
\end_layout

\end_inset

an estimated 100 integrator neurons in total exist on each side of the hindbrain
 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found 6 integrator neurons with ipsilateral axonal projections, and 8
 with contralateral projections, consistent with previous light microscopic
 studies

 Two integrator neurons had axonal arbors that were both ipsilateral and
 contralateral, which has not been previously reported.
 For 6 integrator neurons, an axon could not be identified, presumably because
 it was cut off by the boundary of the imaged volume.
 [description of soma and dendrites will come later] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neuronal cell bodies in this region are organized into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stripes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and previous studies have shown that cell body location relative to these
 stripes is correlated with neurotransmitter identity

.
 On this basis, we inferred that integrator neurons with ipsilaterally projectin
g axons are glutamatergic, and those with contralaterally projecting axons
 are GABAergic.
 Those with ipsilateral and contralateral projections are glutamatergic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identified chemical synapses in our images by the existence of presynaptic
 vesicles and postsynaptic densities.
 All chemical synapses involving integrator neurons contained small vesicles,
 suggesting the presence of conventional rather than peptidergic neurotransmitte
rs.
 Dense core vesicles were found at other synapses in the same region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found one example of an ipsilaterally-projecting integrator neuron that
 made two synapses onto another ipsilaterally-projecting integrator neuron.
 The same source neuron also synapsed onto two contralaterally-projecting
 integrator neurons.
 This provides the first evidence that integrator neurons make synapses
 onto each other.
 The existence of recurrent synapses between integrator neurons has long
 been hypothesized by many computational models of the neural integrator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neural circuits transform activity and produce activity that is either sent
 to higher brain areas or to muscles to elicit behavior.
 A very simplistic example of this idea is that of the reflex arc, where
 sensory information is relayed to motor neurons in the spinal chord, in
 order to elicit a reflex.
 More complex behaviors, transform the incoming activity to produce a different/
unique output.
 This transformation presumably involves the integration of signals form
 multiple neurons, to produce a suitable output.
 For example a 5 day old larval zebrafish can perform multiple sensory motor
 integrating tasks like tracking of prey and predator avoidance.
 In such behaviors, multiple sensory inputs converge on different brain
 areas, these signals are then transformed to infer motion of prey, or predator
 and elicit a behavior to swim towards or away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand the specific roles of neurons in these behavior, we could
 benefit form as many tools as are available to 'break' the circuit apart.
 In this regard, again, the larval zebrafish is ideally suited for circuit
 based neuroscience (refs).
 It offers the convenience of powerful genetic tools, well-stocked mutant
 libraries and more importantly for circuit neuroscience, the transparent
 brain of the larval zebrafish, coupled with genetic calcium based reporters
 and light-sheet microscopy, has allowed unprecedented ability to image
 from the whole brain (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ahrens:2012ej,Ahrens:2015gv,Friedrich:2010hj"

\end_inset

).
 Although the activity of neurons during such tasks is typically distributed
 over multiple brain areas, it is known to be conserved from animal to animal
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Portugues:2014fn"

\end_inset

).
 Recent advances in high-throughput electron microscopy now allows us to
 integrate detailed anatomical features from physiologically recorded cells
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Briggman:2011ct,Helmstaedter:2013iv,Takemura:2013ea"

\end_inset

).
 In the Drosophila larva, such techniques have allowed for the discovery
 of complex architectures that allow for the convergence of multiple inputs
 from multiple sensory modalities (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ohyama:2015kb"

\end_inset

).
 Similarly, a novel circuit for locomotion, consisting of alternating excitatory
 and inhibitory neurons was show to be responsible for larvae locomotion
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Fushiki:2016ji"

\end_inset

).
 These studies also, highlight the the fact that some of these fundamental
 sensory transformations are likely conserved across invertebrates and vertebrat
es (

Here we combined functional calcium imaging along with serial-section electron
 microscopy in the larval zebrafish hindbrain.
 We looked at a circuit that is responsible for the stabilization of the
 eye during periods of eye-fixation.
 Spontaneous saccadic eye-movements are typically followed by short periods
 of eye-fixation for a few seconds.
 During these fixations, the motor neurons that innervate the eye muscles,
 receive a tonic input from a subset of neurons in the hindbrain (cite).
 This subset of neurons are responsible for transforming the incoming eye-veloci
ty signals from saccadic neurons, to eye-position signals.
 This transformation, from velocity to position, suggests that these neurons
 are performing temporal integration.
 These cells are therefore referred to as velocity-to-position neural integrator
 cells (VPNI).
 Similar neurons have been shown to exist in the goldfish area1 (cite) and
 in the non-human primate (cite).
 In the goldfish brain stem, eye-position sensitive cells were seen to be
 have similar morphologies, with ipsilaterally projecting cells having large
 dendritic fields with axons that gave rise to collaterals and contralateral
 projecting cells what did not have any ipsilateral projections and smaller
 dendritic fields (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Aksay:2000cn"

\end_inset

).
 The emergence of axonal collaterals on the same side as other position
 sensitive cells, suggests the possibility of local feedback loops that
 might drive this persistent activity.
 Supporting this evidence was also evidence that shows that pairs of neurons
 on the same side have highly correlated activity, both in fish (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Aksay:2003un"

\end_inset

) and in monkeys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dale:2015hh"

\end_inset

).
 Neurons that are clustered together, tend to have similar decay times,
 correlate similarly with eye-position and velocity and have high pairwise
 correlations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Here we also show that neurons that are clustered together also have similar
 anatomy and axonal projection patterns.

 A simplistic model, where the neurons are connected to each other recurrently,
 to form a 'loop' can explain such activity, in the absence of inputs.However,

 yet to be answered.

 We located all pre and postsynaptic sites on these cells validated synaptic
 connectivity among VPNI cells.

 Larval zebrafish that were 5-6 dpf were injected with calcium sensitive
 dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 (OGB-1, supplier?) by gently removing skin
 over the hindbrain and using a patch pipette for iontophoresis.
 The next day the animals were imaged on a custom two-photon microscope
 (wavelength).
 The animal was immobilized in low melting agar and was positioned to view
 a monitor with light gratings.
 The hindbrain of the animal was imaged at (

 Following functional imaging, the animal was then imaged on the same setup
 for anatomical imaging.
 Briefly, a stack was acquired over the same imaging window, with optical
 sections every 1.3 µm, and with a lateral resolution of 0.5 µm.
 Once this was performed, the animal was anesthetized and the skin over
 the hindbrain was removed, to facilitate penetration of the fixative, and
 the animal was immersed in fixative to preserve the ultrastructure.
 We found that the removal of the skin over the hindbrain was important
 for good ultrastructure preservation and for even staining of the tissue.

The optically imaged animals were immersed in a fixative of 1% paraformaldehyde
 and 1% glutaraldehyde buffered in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 24 hrs.
 Then they were throughly washed in 0.1M cacodylate buffer before staining.
 The tissue was stained using a conventional ROTO procedure (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 Following staining, the tissue was infiltrated with an LX-112 based EPON
 resin for 24 hrs and baked for 48 hrs at 60 C.
 The EPON based resin was tailored to be a low viscosity resin to help with
 better infiltration for this tissue.
 Following hardening, the tissue block face was coarsely trimmed and a rectangul
ar mesa was defined for serial sectioning.
 Care was taken to orient the specimen to permit sectioning along the horizontal
 axis.
 Serial sections from the above animal were collected approximately from
 the level of the Mauthner cell at a thickness of 45 nm.
 The serial sections were collected using the automatic tape-collecting
 ultramicrotome (ATUM) (

 The serial sections were then adhered to a silicon wafer, using double

 of carbon to make them conductive.
 Each wafer was imaged in a Zeiss Sigma field emitting scanning electron

 Briefly, to locate the same cells that were id'ed form the functional imaging,
 the LM volume was registered to the EM volume.
 This was done using gross anatomical features like easily recognized clusters
 of cell bodies and blood vessels, that was readily visible in both the
 LM and the EM volumes.
 These features served as anatomical landmarks, where each pair of features
 were marked as a corresponding pair that was subsequently used to generate
 a transform.
 Once we had many such corresponding pairs, they were used to generate an
 affine transform that was used to register the LM volume on the EM volume.
 This process was also performed in the Fiji plugin TrakEM2 (

 This process resulted in overlaying the LM volume onto the EM volume.

 to and below the Mauthner cell ( fig 1A, panel1), unilaterally.
 This landmark would later serve to identify cells in the electron microscopy
 volume, since the Mauthner cell is immediately visible in EM sections.
 Following the functional imaging, the volume was imaged for anatomical
 landmarks, like blood vessels and location of cell bodies, this volume
 was termed the Light Microscopy (LM) volume (Fig 1A, panel 2).
 We later extracted the locations of cells whose firing had high degree
 of correlation to eye-position, and had the firing characteristic of neural
 integrator cells (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), these cells were labeled as or eye-position sensitive cells ( Fig 1A,
 panel1).
 These cells have distinct, graded persistent firing during eye fixation,
 as see by the decay time constants of firing during fixation.
 Average saccade triggered responses of these cells show cells with a range
 of persistence times.
 Cell with high persistence had long calcium decay time constants, where
 as leaky cells had shorter decay time constants ( fig 1A, panel 1).

Once functional imaging of the larva was performed, it was immediately prepared
 for electron microscopy by immersing in fixative.
 The larva was processed for electron microscopy using conventional reduced
 osmium staining techniques and embedded in an epoxy based resin (

).
 The tissue block was then coarsely trimmed until the appearance of the
 Mauthner cell plane.
 Following the observation of this landmark , ultra-thin sections ( fig

 tape collecting ultramicrotome (ATUM) as described previously (

 The sections were then made conductive, by evaporating a thin layer of
 carbon and imaged in a field emitting scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)
 to obtain an electron microscopy (EM) volume.
 Each section was imaged at a resolution of 5nm/pixel in a region of interest
 that roughly corresponded with area imaged on the light microscopic ( fig

 Briefly, individual images were first montaged using affine transforms

 Following this they were aligned in the z dimension, using first, affine

\begin_layout Standard
To locate the cells that were involved in the integrator circuit, we first
 extracted the location of cells in the light microscopic volume that were
 eye-position sensitive.
 Once these cells were located in the light microscopic volume, we then
 needed to register the LM stack to the EM stack in order to locate the
 same cells in the EM volume.
 To do this, we made use of the fact that large, gross morphological features
 should be easy to spot in the EM stack ( sup Fig)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once enough such features were identified, we located these same landmarks
 in the high-res EM stack.
 Each pair of landmarks (one from the LM volume and one from the EM volume)
 was then used to calculate a global affine transform that was applied to
 transform the LM volume to be overlaid on the EM volume using the TrakEM2
 plugin in Fiji (

 Following this registration, we were able to reliable locate the same cells

Reconstructions

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstruction of the cells was performed using the TrakEM2 plugin in
 Fiji/ImageJ.
 Two expert tracers reconstructed the cells beginning from the cell bodies
 in an independent manner.
 During the tracing process, one of the expert tracers annotated all pre
 and postsynaptic sites for each cells.
 The skeletonized tree structure was exported from TrakEM2 as *.swc files.
 These trees were then imported into Matlab using custom scripts to import
 .swc files and maintain them as trees.
 The traces of the two tracers were compared by a third reviewer.
 The third reviewer, independently reviewed points of disagreement and decided
 which points of disagreement were either over-reconstructed or were under-recon
structed.
 .
 In some cases, the traces were re-visited by the tracers if it was needed.
 .
 For the comparison of EM traces with LM traces, the LM traces were traced
 using the Simple Neurite Tracer (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) plugin in Fiji, and exported as a *.swc file.
 They were then imported into the same Matlab framework that was used to
 analyze the EM traces, and used to compute necessary features to compare
 the LM traces and the EM traces.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All analysis was performed on Matlab using custom scripts.
 All traces were exported as .swc files from TrakEM2.
 All tree lengths was reported as pathlength unless noted otherwise.
 Similarly, all lengths to a pre or post synaptic site was reported as pathlengt
hs.
 The axon initiation site was annotated as the parent node of the first
 presynaptic site.
 For the putative-axons that originated at the soma, they were annotated
 as beginning from the root node.
 All neurites that were not axonal were called dendritic.
 All nodes of the tree were thus divided as axonal nodes or dendritic nodes.
 Pathlengths were then generated for a tree over all axonal nodes or all
 dendritic nodes, and the length of the tree was the sum of all axonal length
 and dendritic length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diameter of the trees was generated by drawing a line segment across
 the cross-section of the tree at a random location along the tree.
 Many such line segments were drawn across the entire extent of the tree,
 where the tracer was blinded to the fact whether the neurite was an axon
 or a dendrite.
 The measurements were then separated as dendritic diameter or axonal diameter
 after all the trees were measured in this manner.
 The values were reported as a mean across all dendritic or axonal measures
 for a tree.
 A collateral was defined as all those segments of an axon, that emerged
 from the central axonal tree.
 All tree nodes that were axonal were then divided as those that were part
 of a collateral and those that were not.
 Following this, pathlengths and numbers were calculated by treating those
 nodes like any other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arbor densities of the dendrites was computed by projecting all the axonal
 or dendritic nodes along the desired plane and reported in a normalized
 scale.

\change_inserted 78966105 1459268394
 Arbor volumes were computed using the Matlab function convhull.
 The statistics for group3 cells was computed after removoing one outlier
 (Fig 3C, purple cell) from the analysis.
 
\change_deleted 78966105 1459268246

To infer the neurotransmitter identity from the stripe organization of the
 cell bodies, we annotated the location of all the cell bodies from a low-resolu
tion stack.
 The cell density was then computed by projecting all the cells along the
 desired axis.
 This process picked out the peaks that were visible in the EM images.
 The location of a stripe was defined as the local peak that emerged from
 the cell density projecting analysis.

Physiological identification of integrator cells

\begin_layout Standard
To relate physiology and anatomy in the neural integrator circuit of the
 larval zebrafish, we performed two-calcium imaging followed by serial-section
 electron microscopy in the same animal.
 We use the calcium sensitive dye OGB-1 to record from neurons in the hindbrain,
 while the animal made spontaneous saccades.
 A simultaneous recording of the eye movement was also made, that would
 be used to corelate calcium transient with eye-positions (fig1A, panel
 1).
 We then identified integrator somata from the imaged planes using previously
 described methods (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Miri:2011ft"

\end_inset

).
 We identified only those cells whose saccade triggered average fluorescence
 was correlated strongly with saccade triggered eye position (coorelation
 coeff 0.6).
 This process resulted inthe identification of 22 integrator cells from
 3 distinct imaging planes that were 10um apart.
 Following functional imaging, we imaged the entire hindbrain of the animal
 with optical sections that were 1um apart.
 This light microscopic volume (LM volume), contained the location of all
 dye expressing cells and locations of prominent vasculature in the hindbran
 (fig 1A, panel 2).
 Following functional imaging, the animal was then perpared for serial-section
 electron microscopy using a similar process as decribed previously (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hayworth_imaging_2014"

\end_inset

) ( fig 1B).
 This process resulted in a 3D electron microscopic volume (EM volume),
 that overlapped with the LM volume.
 The LM and EM volumes were then registered using the TrakEm2 plugin in
 Fiji/ImageJ (methods) ( fig 1C).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All 22 integrator cells from the LM volume were located in the EM volume
 (fig 1D, panel 2).
 Although these cells were from three distinct planes in the light microscopic

 to three distinct planes, since we annotated the centers of the cells in
 the EM volume.

 We defined neurites as being axonal or dendritic based on the observation
 of pre- or postsynaptic sites along the neurite.
 Of the integrator cells that were reconstructed, there were 7 cells (~31%)
 that had a clear distinguishable axon, with the presence of presynaptic
 sites on their neurites.
 Of the remaining cells, 9 cells (~40%) had putative axon-like neurites.
 The remaining 6 cells (~27%), did not have any distinguishable neurite
 that was axonal in nature.
 All cells had neurites that were dendritic in nature, they were identified
 by the presence of postsynaptic sites that were studded along the neurite.
 In general, we observed cells that had large dendritic fields with long-range
 projecting axons.
 Similarly, we also observed cells that had short stubby dendritic fileds,
 that was almost always contained inside the imaged volume.

 with a tilt in the dorsoventral axis, such that the rostral regions were
 more ventral to the caudal, ventral region.
 From the main trunk, we observed mediolateraly occuring branches, throughout
 the length of the axons.
 Some of these mediolateral branches at the rostral edge of the volume seemed
 to overlap with, and synapse onto other dendrites, roughly with the location
 of the abducens motor nuceli in the larval zebrafish.
 All such mediolateral branches were termed as collaterals.
 In total, we reconstructed 2.7 mm of axons

In contrast to the current work, previous light microscopic reconstructions
 of integrator cells (

) could not visualize synapses, and therefore inferred whether neurites
 were axons or dendrites.
 To investigate the reliability of such inferences, we quantified the caliber
 of our axons and dendrites.
 
\change_deleted 1172979425 1459378600
We measured the diameter of the axon and the dendrites for all integrator
 cells in the imaged volume.
 
\change_inserted 1172979425 1459380384
For x out of y cells, the mean axonal diameter was less than the mean dendrite
 diameter.
 This fits the textbook notion that axons are thinner than dendrites.
 However, the axon was thicker than the dendrites for the remaining cells,
 so inference of neurite identity based on caliber would heen erroneous.

We noticed that a few of the neurites that crossed the midline shared common
 features.
 First, these neurites were 'bare', and devoid of any pre- or postsynaptic
 sites.
 Second, before crossing the midline, the neurite became engulfed by processes
 that appeared glial in nature (Fig 2

\change_deleted 78966105 1459264363

 These features are typical of axons.
 The glial engulfment is consistent with the idea of glial bridges that
 are instrumental in axonal guidance during development (

).
 The lack of presynaptic sites is similar to some of the initial segments
 of the ipsilaterally projecting axons, where there were no presynaptic
 terminals in the early part of the axon, and

 The rostral segment of the axon extended toward the abducens nuclei, which
 contains the motor neurons that innervate the eye muscles.
 The caudal segment extended further into the hindbrain where they presumably
 synapse onto other cells in the rhombomeres.

 In both cells, another neurite crossed the midline.
 We infer that this neurite is a contralaterally projecting axon.
 This cannot be confirmed with certainty, because its presynaptic sites

 Our inference is based on a number of cues as mentioned previously.
 The putative contralaterally projecting axon emerged directly from the
 soma in one cell, and branched from the ipsilaterally projecting axon in
 the other cell.
 In both cases, the midline cross-over happened at locations that were ventral

 Based on the number of terminals that exited the volume, we computed a
 degree of completeness for all the integrator cells ( sup fig, different

 Of the six ipsilaterally projecting cells, three of them were determined

Here we reconstructed in detial, the anatomy of integrator cells, to understand
 coarse .
 Previous attempts to understand the circuit architecture of these cells
 showed that there were atleast two types of cells with different axonal
 projecting patterns that participated in this behavior.
 In the cat prepositous nuceli, where similar integrator neurons reside,
 it was discovered that there were roughly three to four types of cells
 that were morphologically distinct (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "McCrea:1985hx"

\end_inset

).
 There were principal cells, multi-dendritic cells and small cells, that
 had each unique morphology and axonal projections.
 The principal cells, were medium sized cells, importantly with ipsilaterally
 projecting axons that gave rise to local collaterals.
 Where as the multi-dendritic cells typically had complex dendritic patterns,
 with axonal projections that projected on the same side without any local
 collaterals.
 The small cells had dendritic fields similar to the principal cells, but
 with axons that crossed the midline.
 Similarly, in the goldfish brain stem, position sensitive cells were seen
 to be have similar morphologies, with ipsilaterally projecting cells having
 large dendritic fields with axons that gave rise to collaterals and contralater
al projecting cells what did not have any ipsilateral projections and smaller
 dendritic fields (

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 78966105 1459374664
.
 To do this, we functionally imaged cells during spontaneous eye movement,
 to determine the cells involved in the behaviour.
 We discovered atleast three different projection pattern of the axons from
 these cells.
 We uncovered a novel axonal projection pattern that has not been seen previousl
y.
 We also discovered synaptic connections between integrator cells.
 This is the first evidence that validates a long-standing clam that suggest
 these cells to be synaptically connected.

\change_inserted 78966105 1459374751
Our results are in line with previous work that suggests that ipsilateral
 projections are required for the excitatory feedback drive unilaterally.
 The sparse connectivity between ipsilaterally connected cells ties in with
 the fact that integrator cells from the unilateral population do not contribute
 to the entire oculomotor range.
 If this were not the case, we would expect more ubiquitious connections
 between ipsilaterally projecting cells.
 Conversely, these few synapses could be a byproduct of a small number of
 cells with incompletely reconstructed axons.
 This is similar to previous anatomical studies in the goldfish, and in
 the larval zebrafish where known integrator cells were shown to have ipsilatera
lly projecting axons (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Aksay:2000cn,Lee:2015dv"

\end_inset

).
 However, in all previous studies, the axonal identify was only inferred
 indirectly from diameters of neurites.
 Here however, we were able to directly identify the axon, based on the
 presence of presynaptic sites.
 We also uncoverered that in all cells ipsilaterally projecting cells, the
 axon did not originate at the cell body, infact, it does so along a secondary
 or tertiary dendrite that had postsynaptic sites on it.
 Similarly, we also discovered two cases of cells where there was more than
 one axon that originated from the cell.
 We were able to infer the neurotransmitter identity of cells form this
 group based on the location of the cell somata.
 Previously, It is thought that these ipsilaterally projecting cells are
 excitatiry, and must be responsible for unilateral excitatation.

The emergence of axonal collaterals on the same side as other position sensitive
 cells, suggests the possibility of local feedback loops that might drive
 this persistent activity.
 Supporting this evidence was also evidence that shows that pairs of neurons
 on the same side have highly correlated activity, both in fish (

 For the eyes to have coordinated movement, there must exist mutual inhibition
 between integrators on either side of the midline, which would presumably
 be inhibitory in nature (

However, beyond this we do not know much about the detailed morphology of
 these cells, how many synapses do they have, who are their synaptic partners.
 We do not yet know if position sensitive cells synapses onto each other,
 although indirect evidence would suggest that they do (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Aksay:2003un,Dale:2015hh"

\end_inset

).
 To answer some of these question, we chose to perform serial electron microscop
y on position sensitive cells in the hindbrain of larval zebrafish.
 The larval zebrafish is believed to have ~100 integrator neurons unilaterally,
 which makes such a system amenable to large scale imaging efforts, and
 that the organization of these cells in the larval animal might most likely
 be conserved in the adult (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gilland_hindbrain_2014"

\end_inset

).
 This analysis reveled that the existence of at least three groups of neurons
 that were part of the unilateral integrator.
 We found neurons with ipsilateral axons that gave rise to collaterals within
 the same dendritic field as other integrator neurons.
 Apart from the previously know ipsilateral and contralateral projections
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lee:2015dv"

\end_inset

), we found few neurons with both ipsi and contralateral projections.
 Distribution of synaptic locations of both pre and post synapses for all
 neurons revealed on average these cells received three time more input
 than output.
 We can extend the significance of these findings by inferring the neurotransmit
ter identity of these neurons based on the location of the cells bodies,
 as they are known to express glutamate and GABA in alternative stripe like
 patterns in the hindbrain (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kinkhabwala:2011et"

\end_inset

).
 Doing so, suggests that the cells with ipsilaterally projecting axons and
 collaterals is excitatory, cells with contralatrally projecting axons are
 inhibitory.
 The remaining groups are presumably putative glutamatergic and glycenergic
 neurons.
 These results suggest that the neural integration is achieved by positive
 excitatory feedback unilaterally, and by mutual inhibition contralaterally.

Larval zebrafish neurons in the hindbrain were loaded with calcium sensitive

 made spontaneous saccades.
 The same animal was then processed for serial electron microscopy.

Registration of functionally imaged larval zebrafish to serial electron
 microscope images.
 (A) Schematic of the experimental setup with an example of the functional
 data that is obtained from two-photon light microscopy of calcium dye,
 during saccadic behavior.
 (B) Serial electron microscopy of same zebrafish from A, sections are collected
 on tape in an automated manner, images at low-res are use to align the
 sections, followed by images at high-resolution over the region of interest.
 3D volume of the imaged area.
 (C) Registration of LM volume to EM volume to locate the cells that were
 involved in the behavior.
 Arrows indicate the same features in both LM and EM.
 (D) Anatomical location of all cell bodies involved in the behavior along
 with anatomical landmarks from the EM volume.
 (E) Functional data showing the average saccadic response for all cells.

VPNI cell anatomical features, reconstructed from EM volume.
 (A) Example of VPNI cell showing axon (dark segments) and dendrite (light
 segments) with pre and postsynaptic locations.
 Parts of the axon of this VPNI cell are myelinated.
 Insets, (black dots) show the start, middle and the end of a myelinated
 segment of the axon.
 Other myelinated segments are highlighted in the colored box.
 Open arrow heads show the location of axon initiation zones along the neurite.
 (B) Example VPNI cell with putative-axon that is engulfed by glial processes
 before crossing the midline (inset right- colored segments are glial).
 Microtubule rich neurite that emerges from cell somata show in left inset.
 (C) VPNI cells with putative-axon that is engulfed by glia before midline
 crossing (right inset).
 Ipsilateral axon and dendrite also present for this VPNI cell.
 (D) VPNI cells with single neurite that branches to give rise to axon and
 dendrites.
 Axon is studded with presynaptic sites that are clustered along neurite.
 Inset is a 3D reconstruction of axon termination zone with large vesicle
 cloud with multiple post synaptic densities opposed to the vesicles.
