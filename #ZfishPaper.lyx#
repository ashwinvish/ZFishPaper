\begin_layout Abstract
Neural integrators are involved in a variety of sensorimotor and cognitive
 behaviors.
 The oculomotor system contains a simple example, a hindbrain neural circuit
 that takes velocity signals as inputs, and integrates them to control eye
 position.
 We combined observations of behavior, physiology, and anatomy to study
 integrator neurons.
 Two-photon calcium imaging of the larval zebrafish hindbrain was performed
 while simultaneously monitoring spontaneous eye movements.
 Integrator neurons were identified as those cells with activities highly
 correlated with eye position, and the same neurons were then reconstructed
 from serial electron microscopic images.
 Cell bodies in more rostral locations had ipsilaterally projecting axons,
 identified by the existence of presynaptic boutons containing vesicles.
 Cell bodies in more caudal locations appeared to have contralaterally projectin
g axons, identified by a distinctive glial ensheathment near the midline.
 Cells with both ipsilateral and contralateral projections were also reconstruct
ed.
 Based on previous reports of correlation between somatic location and neurotran
smitter identity, we infer that cells with only ipsilaterally projecting
 axons are largely glutamatergic and excitatory, whereas cells with only
 contralaterally projecting axons are largely GABAergic and inhibitory.
 We observed the first

evidence of synapses between integrator neurons, from an ipsilaterally projectin
g cell onto other cells.

 Here we extend this approach by combining two-photon calcium imaging of
 neurons in a behaving fish with subsequent reconstructions of the same
 neurons using serial electron microscopy.
 The behavior is spontaneous eye movements, and the neurons are in a hindbrain
 neural circuit known as the "velocity-to-position neural integrator," or
 "neural integrator" for short

\begin_layout Standard
Integrator cells are operationally defined as premotor neurons that carry
 a horizontal eye position signal in their spiking.
 (There is also an integrator for vertical eye movements, but it will not
 be discussed here.) Integrator cells are thought to send their eye position
 signals through direct synapses onto extraocular motor neurons in the ipsilater
al abducens nucleus.
 They are also thought to receive signals from multiple convergent pathways
 that encode eye velocity for every type of eye movement.
 Therefore, the neural integrator is the

 The neural integrator gets its name because the transformation of eye velocity
 into eye position is the computational operation of integration with respect
 to time.

 Many hypotheses and models have been proposed, and a number of them depend
 on assumptions about the structure of the underlying neural circuit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Testing these assumptions requires studies that correlate structure and
 function of integrator neurons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Structure-function studies were previously performed by two methods.
 The first relied on intracellular recording to identify goldfish hindbrain
 neurons exhibiting spiking correlated with eye position 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aksay:2000cn"

\end_inset

.
 Dye was injected into these cells, which were then reconstructed.
 The second method relied on two-photon calcium imaging to identify zebrafish
 integrator neurons with eye position signals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee:2015dv"

\end_inset

.
 These were targeted for single cell electroporation of a fluorescent indicator
 and reconstructed.
 Both of these studies relied on light microscopy for structural information.
 As a result, they were limited to one or a few neurons in any individual
 brain, and could not positively identify synapses.
 They could not conclusively distinguish between axon and dendrite, nor
 could they examine connectivity between integrator neurons.
 This paper applies serial section electron microscopy (EM) to yield improved
 structural information about many integrator neurons from a single animal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integrator neurons were identified in the hindbrain of a larval zebrafish
 using two-photon calcium imaging while recording spontaneous eye movements.
 The same region of the hindbrain was then imaged via serial section electron
 microscopy.
 Analysis of the calcium data identified 22 integrator neurons, defined
 by neural activities that were highly correlated with eye position.
 The same neurons were located in the EM dataset, and their neurites were
 completely reconstructed within the confines of the imaged volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identified chemical synapses in our images by the existence of presynaptic
 vesicles and postsynaptic densities.
 All chemical synapses involving integrator neurons contained small vesicles,
 suggesting the presence of conventional rather than peptidergic neurotransmitte
rs.
 Dense core vesicles were found at other synapses in the same region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found 6 integrator neurons with only ipsilaterally projecting axons,
 identified by the existence of presynaptic boutons containing vesicles.
 We found 8 integrator neurons with only contralaterally projecting axons,
 identified by a distinctive glial ensheathment near the midline.
 Both axonal projection patterns are consistent with a previous report based
 on light microscopy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee:2015dv"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, we found two integrator neurons with axonal arbors that were
 both ipsilateral and contralateral, which has not been previously reported.
 For 6 integrator neurons, an axon could not be identified, presumably because
 it was cut off by the boundary of the imaged volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found one example of an ipsilaterally-projecting integrator neuron that
 made two synapses onto another ipsilaterally-projecting integrator neuron.
 The same source neuron also synapsed onto two contralaterally-projecting
 integrator neurons.
 This provides the first evidence that integrator neurons make synapses
 onto each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neuronal cell bodies in this region are organized into

stripes,

 and previous studies have shown that cell body location relative to these
 stripes is correlated with neurotransmitter identity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 On this basis, we inferred that integrator neurons with only ipsilaterally
 projecting axons are glutamatergic, and those with only contralaterally
 projecting axons are GABAergic.

Calcium signals were correlated with eye position to identify integrator
 somata from the imaged planes (

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 If saccade-triggered average fluorescence was correlated strongly with
 saccade-triggered eye position (Pearson coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.6$
\end_inset

), the cell was identified as an integrator neuron (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177748

\change_inserted 78966105 1461177818
, c
\change_unchanged
).
 These cells have distinct, graded persistent firing during eye fixation,
 as seen by the decay time constants of firing during fixation.
 Average saccade triggered responses of these cells show cells with a range
 of persistence times.
 Cells with high persistence had long calcium decay time constants, where
 as leaky cells had shorter decay time constants (

 This resulted in the identification of 22 integrator cells from 3 distinct

\begin_layout Standard
Following functional imaging, we imaged the entire hindbrain of the animal

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Somata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The somata of the 22 integrator cells spanned 23 µm in the dorsoventral
 axis and the entire rostrocaudal extent of the imaged volume.
 The soma locations ended up in three broad clusters.
 The first cluster of cells was located very close to the midline and at
 the rostral end of the imaged volume.
 The second cluster of cells was located at the caudal end of the imaged
 volume, lateral to the first cluster.
 A third loose cluster of cells was located at the lateral end of the volume,
 with cells that spanned the entire rostrocaudal range (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177748
Fig
\change_unchanged
.
 1D).
 The average diameter of somata was 
\begin_inset Formula $4.5\pm0.6\:\mu m$
\end_inset

 (mean ± standard deviation).
 On average 
\begin_inset Formula $3.3\pm1.5$
\end_inset


\change_deleted 78966105 1461101606
 
\change_unchanged
 neurites emerged from the somata, and traveled ventrally.
 Some neurites exited the imaged volume, leading to incompletely reconstructed
 cells.
 On average, fully reconstructed cells had total neurite length of 
\begin_inset Formula $832\pm269$
\end_inset

 µm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Synapses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identified synapses by the presence of a presynaptic vesicle pool and
 an opposing postsynaptic density (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177748
Fig
\change_unchanged
.
 2B
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178211
, EM panels
\change_unchanged
).
 Synapses from or onto integrator neurons contained small vesicles, presumably
 containing a conventional neurotransmitter.
 Elsewhere in the volume we did identify synapses with dense core vesicles,
 presumably containing a peptide neurotransmitter (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178781
Sup.

\change_unchanged
 
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177768
Fig.
 1
\change_unchanged
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The postsynaptic densities were observed as a darkening of the membrane,
 indicative of more electron dense regions (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177748
Fig
\change_unchanged
.
 2B).
 The presynaptic site was generally at a varicosity in the axon with vesicles
 throughout.
 Opposing the postsynaptic density, a small, denser cluster of vesicles
 was typically observed, along with a presynaptic density.
 These features are consistent with the idea of a presynaptic active zone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In total, we annotated 406 presynaptic and 2229 postsynaptic sites on integrator
 neurons.
 The number of postsynaptic sites on a cell averaged 
\begin_inset Formula $101\pm74$
\end_inset

.
 This is a reasonable estimate of the number of input synapses to an integrator
 neuron, because most dendritic arbors were reconstructed in their entirety.
 The number of presynaptic sites on a cell averaged 
\begin_inset Formula $58\pm44.39$
\end_inset

.
 This is an underestimate of the number of output synapses from an integrator
 neuron, because most axonal arbors were cut off by the borders of the volume.
 If statistics are restricted to the
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178318
 3
\change_unchanged
 cells that were more complete than others, there were 
\begin_inset Formula $156\pm47.46$
\end_inset

 postsynaptic sites and 
\begin_inset Formula $97\pm38$
\end_inset

 presynaptic sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along the somatic membrane, a darkening of the membrane interrupted by small
 gaps was often observed (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178781
Sup.

\change_unchanged
 
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178331
Fig.
 2
\change_unchanged
).
 The darkening persisted over multiple serial sections, suggesting that
 it was not an artifact of tissue preparation or imaging.
 We speculate that these darkenings are electrical synapses, which are known
 to exist in the developing larval zebrafish hindbrain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We cannot be sure of our interpretation because of our limited image resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dendrites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dendrites were defined by the absence of presynaptic vesicles and the presence
 of postsynaptic densities.
 They were mostly oriented along the mediolateral axis, but some exceptions
 were oriented rostrocaudally.
 Dendrites were smooth rather than spiny (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178365

 The dendritic arbors of these cells fell into a distribution with a long

 Cells with small arbors were completely reconstructed and did not have
 any dendrites that left the imaged volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Axons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined axons as neurites with presynaptic vesicles.
 No axons were observed emerging directly from the cell body.
 Instead, dendrites bearing postsynaptic sites turned into axons with presynapti
c sites.
 Two example dendrite-axon transitions are indicated in 
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178433

 2A and B
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178445
 (open arrow)
\change_unchanged
.
 The main trunk of the axon extended rostrally and ventrally (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177748

,C
\change_unchanged
).
 From the main trunk emerged mediolateral branches, which we will term collatera
ls.
 Those at the rostral extreme of the volume appeared to overlap with the
 expected location of the abducens motor nucleus (based on its known position
 
\change_inserted 78966105 1460919334
within rhombomere r5,6)
\change_unchanged
 .
 In total, we reconstructed 1.62 mm of axonal length in the imaged volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed dark sheaths around some axonal segments.
 In some locations, we saw evidence that the sheath wrapped around the axon
 multiple times (

 Mediolateral collaterals emerged from the gaps in myelination, and remained

Caliber of neurites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the current work, previous light microscopic reconstructions
 of integrator cells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee:2015dv"

\end_inset

 could not visualize synapses, and therefore inferred whether neurites were
 axons or dendrites.
 To investigate the reliability of such inferences, we quantified the caliber
 of our axons and dendrites.
 For 20 out of 22 cells, the mean axonal diameter was less than the mean
 dendrite diameter, conforming to the textbook notion that axons are thinner
 than dendrites (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461177748
Fig
\change_unchanged
.
 3H).
 However, the axon was thicker than the dendrites for the remaining two
 cells, so inference of neurite identity based on caliber would have been
 erroneous for these cells.
 Furthermore, neurite diameters are close to the diffraction limit, so that
 light microscopic estimation of dendritic diameters could be inaccurate.

Small protuberances

\begin_layout Standard
A small fraction (3% or 89/2229) of the postsynaptic sites were located
 on finger-like projections from dendrites that were enveloped by invaginations
 of axonal boutons (

 These projections resemble structures found across multiple species called

\begin_layout Standard
We noticed that a few of the neurites that crossed the midline shared common
 features.
 First, these neurites were devoid of any pre- or postsynaptic sites.
 Second, before crossing the midline, the neurite became engulfed by processes
 that appeared glial in nature (
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178725

 2 C,D).
 These features are typical of axons.
 The glial engulfment is consistent with the idea of glial bridges that
 are instrumental in axonal guidance during development

.
 The lack of presynaptic sites is similar to some of the initial segments
 of the ipsilaterally projecting axons, where there were no presynaptic
 terminals in the early part of the axon, and presynaptic sites emerged
 only later on.
 Finally, the diameter of these neurites were similar to the diameters of
 ipsilaterally projecting axons (

 We therefore infer that these neurites are contralaterally projecting axons.

 In both cells, another neurite crossed the midline.
 We infer that this neurite is a contralaterally projecting axon.
 This cannot be confirmed with certainty, because its presynaptic sites
 are on the contralateral side of the hindbrain, outside the imaged volume.
 Our inference is based on a number of cues as mentioned previously.
 The putative contralaterally projecting axon emerged directly from the
 soma in one cell, and branched from the ipsilaterally projecting axon in
 the other cell.
 In both cases, the midline cross-over happened at locations that were ventral

 the emergence of alternating peaks of cell somata and neuropil, reminiscent
 of the stripe like pattern.
 We were able to locate 4 peaks, each corresponding to a likely stripe (

.
 Eight of the reconstructed cells had ipsilaterally projecting axons.
 Of these, one cell made synapses onto other reconstructed neurons.
 This may be an underestimate of integrator connectivity, for several reasons.
 First, there are many cells in the imaged volume that carried no usable
 calcium signal at all, largely because they did not take up enough calcium
 indicator.
 Some of these cells are likely to be integrator neurons overlooked by our
 study, and are potential postsynaptic partners of the reconstructed cells
 in our sample.
 Second, there are many integrator neurons outside the imaged volume, and
 they could receive synapses from our reconstructed integrator neurons.
 (Only three axonal arbors were fully or mostly reconstructed; the rest
 appeared substantially cut off as their axons left the volume.) Third, we
 had no possibility of finding connections between neurons on opposite sides
 of the brain, because only one side of the brain was imaged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work provides the first conclusive evidence for synapses between integrator
 neurons.
 This has long been suspected but experimental confirmation has eluded researche
rs for decades.
 It is difficult to know whether the single cell that made synapses onto
 other integrator neurons is an exceptional case, or a representative of
 a larger population that was incompletely sampled.
 One intriguing possibility is that the integrator population contains a
 subset of cells are well-connected with each other, while the rest mainly
 make synapses onto neurons outside the integrator.
 More definitive information about connectivity patterns between integrator
 cells awaits a future experiment with an imaged volume that is large enough
 to encompass all integrator cells, and a fluorescent calcium indicator
 that labels a higher percentage of integrator cells.

 a monitor with light gratings.
 The hindbrain of the animal was imaged at (wavelength) at predefined plane
 at (speed Hz).
 Following functional imaging, the animal was then imaged on the same setup
 for anatomical imaging.
 Briefly, a stack was acquired over the same imaging window, with optical
 sections every 1.3 µm, and with a lateral resolution of 0.5 µm.
 Once this was performed, the animal was anesthetized and the skin over
 the hindbrain was removed, to facilitate penetration of the fixative, and
 the animal was immersed in fixative to preserve the ultrastructure.
 We found that the removal of the skin over the hindbrain was important
 for good ultrastructure preservation and for even staining of the tissue.

The animal was immersed in a fixative of 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehy
de buffered in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 24 hrs.
 Then it was thoroughly washed in 0.1M cacodylate buffer before staining.
 The tissue was stained using a conventional ROTO procedure (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 Following staining, the tissue was infiltrated with an LX-112 based EPON
 resin for 24 hrs and baked for 48 hrs at 60 C.
 The EPON based resin was tailored to be a low viscosity resin to help with
 better infiltration for this tissue.
 Following hardening, the tissue block face was coarsely trimmed and a rectangul
ar mesa was defined for serial sectioning.
 Care was taken to orient the specimen to permit sectioning along the horizontal
 axis.
 Serial sections from the above animal were collected approximately from
 the level of the Mauthner cell at a thickness of 45 nm.
 The serial sections were collected using the automatic tape-collecting
 ultramicrotome (ATUM)

\end_inset

.
 The serial sections were then adhered to a silicon wafer, using double
 sided carbon tape (TEDpella), the wafers were coated with a thin film of
 carbon to make them conductive.
 Each wafer was imaged in a Zeiss Sigma field emitting scanning electron
 microscope in the backscattered electron mode using a custom software interface
 to collected the images (

 The imaged volume was

 The images were montaged and aligned using the TrakEM2 plugin in FIJI/ImageJ
 (

 Briefly, images were imported into the TrakEM2 framework and montaged,
 first, using affine transforms, followed by elastic transforms.
 The images were then registered using a similar approach, where the first
 pass was performed using affine transforms, followed by elastic transforms.
 All the alignment was performed on a machine with 32 cores and 120GB RAM.

We first identified potential integrator cells from the LM dataset using
 methods that were previously described (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Miri:2011ft"

\end_inset

).
 Briefly, to locate the same cells that were id'ed form the functional imaging,
 the LM volume was registered to the EM volume.
 This was done using gross anatomical features like easily recognized clusters
 of cell bodies and blood vessels, that was readily visible in both the
 LM and the EM volumes.
 These features served as anatomical landmarks, where each pair of features
 were marked as a corresponding pair that was subsequently used to generate
 a transform.
 Once we had many such corresponding pairs, they were used to generate an
 affine transform that was used to register the LM volume on the EM volume.
 This process was also performed in the Fiji plugin TrakEM2 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cardona:2012kf"

\end_inset

).
 This process resulted in overlaying the LM volume onto the EM volume.
 Once this was done, we were able to locate the VPNI cells in the EM volume.
 Although these cells were from three distinct planes in the light microscopic
 volume, their locations in the EM volume was not necessarily restricted
 to three distinct planes, since we annotated the centers of the cells in
 the EM volume.

We first performed functional imaging in an awake, immobilized larval zebrafish

 Once this was done, the animal was placed in an imaging setup that allowed
 for imaging the activity in the hindbrain, while simultaneously imaging
 the eye movement behavior.

This paradigm allows for the correlation of eye movement behavior to the
 firing of cells in the hindbrain .
 We performed the functional light microscopy at pre-defined planes close
 to and below the Mauthner cell (

 This landmark would later serve to identify cells in the electron microscopy
 volume, since the Mauthner cell is immediately visible in EM sections.
 Following the functional imaging, the volume was imaged for anatomical
 landmarks, like blood vessels and location of cell bodies, this volume
 was termed the light microscopy (LM) volume (

 We later extracted the locations of cells whose firing had high degree
 of correlation to eye-position, and had the firing characteristic of neural
 integrator cells .

Once functional imaging of the larva was performed, it was immediately prepared
 for electron microscopy by immersing in fixative.
 The larva was processed for electron microscopy using conventional reduced
 osmium staining techniques and embedded in an epoxy based resin (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 The tissue block was then coarsely trimmed until the appearance of the
 Mauthner cell plane.
 Following the observation of this landmark , ultra-thin sections (

 tape collecting ultramicrotome (ATUM) as described previously (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 The sections were then made conductive, by evaporating a thin layer of
 carbon and imaged in a field emitting scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)
 to obtain an electron microscopy (EM) volume.
 Each section was imaged at a resolution of 5nm/pixel in a region of interest
 that roughly corresponded with area imaged on the light microscopic (

 These images were registered using the trakEM2 plugin in Fiji (

 Briefly, individual images were first montaged using affine transforms
 followed by elastic transforms.
 Following this they were aligned in the z dimension, using first, affine
 and followed by elastic transforms.

\begin_layout Standard
To locate the cells that were involved in the integrator circuit, we first
 extracted the location of cells in the light microscopic volume that were
 eye-position sensitive.
 Once these cells were located in the light microscopic volume, we then
 needed to register the LM stack to the EM stack in order to locate the
 same cells in the EM volume.
 To do this, we made use of the fact that large, gross morphological features
 should be easy to spot in the EM stack (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once enough such features were identified, we located these same landmarks
 in the high-res EM stack.
 Each pair of landmarks (one from the LM volume and one from the EM volume)
 was then used to calculate a global affine transform that was applied to
 transform the LM volume to be overlaid on the EM volume using the TrakEM2
 plugin in Fiji (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Following this registration, we were able to reliable locate the same cells
 from the LM and the EM volumes (

Reconstructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstruction of the cells was performed using the TrakEM2 plugin in
 Fiji/ImageJ.
 Two expert tracers reconstructed the cells beginning from the cell bodies
 in an independent manner.
 During the tracing process, one of the expert tracers annotated all pre
 and postsynaptic sites for each cells.
 The skeletonized tree structure was exported from TrakEM2 as *.swc files.
 These trees were then imported into Matlab using custom scripts to import
 .swc files and maintain them as trees.
 The traces of the two tracers were compared by a third reviewer.
 The third reviewer, independently reviewed points of disagreement and decided
 which points of disagreement were either over-reconstructed or were under-recon
structed.
 .
 In some cases, the traces were re-visited by the tracers if it was needed.
 .
 For the comparison of EM traces with LM traces, the LM traces were traced
 using the Simple Neurite Tracer (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Longair:2011hr"

\end_inset

) plugin in Fiji, and exported as a *.swc file.
 They were then imported into the same Matlab framework that was used to
 analyze the EM traces, and used to compute necessary features to compare
 the LM traces and the EM traces.
 The total length of all reconstructed neurites in the imaged volume was
 9.55 mm.
 In some cases, the neurite of the cells exited the volume and were thus
 under reconstructed.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All analysis was performed on Matlab using custom scripts.
 All traces were exported as .swc files from TrakEM2.
 All tree lengths was reported as pathlengths unless noted otherwise.
 Similarly, all lengths to a pre or post synaptic site was reported as pathlengt
hs.
 The axon initiation site was annotated as the parent node of the first
 presynaptic site.
 For the putative-axons that originated at the soma, they were annotated
 as beginning from the root node.
 One cell from 
\change_inserted 78966105 1461178928

\change_deleted 78966105 1461178928

\change_unchanged
 had a putative axon, based on thinness of the axons and the 'bare' initial
 segment.
 All neurites that were not axonal were called dendritic.
 All nodes of the tree were thus divided as axonal nodes or dendritic nodes.
 Pathlengths were then generated for a tree over all axonal nodes or all
 dendritic nodes, and the length of the tree was the sum of all axonal length
 and dendritic length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diameter of the trees was generated by drawing a line segment across
 the cross-section of the tree at a random location along the tree.
 Many such line segments were drawn across the entire extent of the tree,
 where the tracer was blinded to the fact whether the neurite was an axon
 or a dendrite.
 The measurements were then separated as dendritic diameter or axonal diameter
 after all the trees were measured in this manner.
 The values were reported as a mean across all dendritic or axonal measures
 for a tree.
 A collateral was defined as all those segments of an axon, that emerged
 from the central axonal tree.
 All tree nodes that were axonal were then divided as those that were part
 of a collateral and those that were not.
 Following this, pathlengths and numbers were calculated by treating those
 nodes like any other.
 The completeness of cells was decided based on the number of neurites that
 exited the cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arbor densities of the dendrites was computed by projecting all the axonal
 or dendritic nodes along the desired plane and reported in a normalized
 scale.
 Arbor volumes were computed using the Matlab function

 The statistics for group3 cells was computed after removing one outlier

 3C, purple cell) from the analysis.
 To infer the neurotransmitter identity from the stripe organization of
 the cell bodies, we annotated the location of all the cell bodies from
 a low-resolution stack.
 The cell density was then computed by projecting all the cells along the
 desired axis.
 This process picked out the peaks that were visible in the EM images.
 The location of a stripe was defined as the local peak that emerged from
 the cell density projecting analysis.

Top view of integrator cells that are synaptically connected.
 All synapses were from one cell (green) in ipsi-only group (arrow) onto
 one other cell from group 1 (red).
 One synapses each from group 1 cells (green) onto two group2 cells ( purple
 and magenta).
 Black dots represent the site of the synapses, with insets showing the
 electron micrograph at the respective location.
 In all electron micrographs, green color is the presynaptic cell, the postsynap
tic sites are the same color as the cell somata.
 Remaining panels are of the same four cells viewed from orthogonal planes.
 (B) Potential synapse analysis of all sites that are 
\begin_inset Formula $<1\:\mu m$
\end_inset

 from each other.
 Cell # 2 (arrow), is the same cell in (A, green) that makes maximum number
 of potential synapses onto other cells, also makes the real synapses shown
 in (A).
 The real synapses are represented by the black circle in the header.
 (C) Electron micrograph overlaid with identified integratoc cells (colored
 circles), all cells in the imaged volume (grey dots) and anatomical landmarks
 (colored stars).
 Lower panel is a distribution of all cells with integrator cells overlaid.
 Dotted line correspond with hindbrain stripes with known neurotransmitter
 identities.
