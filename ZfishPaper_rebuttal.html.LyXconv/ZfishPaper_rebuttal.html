<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Combining two-photon calcium imaging with serial electron microscopy (EM) is an emerging approach for studying the
structure and function of neural circuits at cellular resolution. In the mouse retina [<a 
href="#XBriggman:2011ct">1</a>] and primary visual cortex [<a 
href="#XBock:2011fk">2</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XLee:2016ti">3</a>], this
approach has been used to study the structure and function of visual neurons. Here we apply this approach to a population of
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
neurons defined by their encoding of behavioral variables, rather than stimulus variables. Namely, we focus on neurons
that carry eye position signals that are located in a hindbrain neural circuit known as the "velocity-to-position
neural integrator," or "neural integrator" for short [<a 
href="#XMajor:2004dk">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XJoshua:2015kx">5</a>]. Our study is done in the larval zebrafish, which has
emerged as an important model organism for investigating the relation between neural circuits and behavior
[<a 
href="#XFriedrich:2010hj">6</a>].
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   The neural integrator gets its name because the transformation of eye velocity into eye position is the computational
operation of integration with respect to time. Integrator neurons are operationally defined as premotor neurons that carry a
horizontal eye position signal in their spiking (there is also an integrator for vertical eye movements, but it will not be discussed
here). Integrator neurons are thought to send their eye position signals to extraocular motor neurons through
monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways. They are also thought to receive inputs from multiple convergent pathways
that encode eye velocity for every type of eye movement. Therefore, the neural integrator is the &#8220;final common
pathway&#8221; for all types of eye movements in fish [<a 
href="#XPastor:1994tx">7</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XAksay:2000cn">8</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XAksay:2001fx">9</a>], rodents [<a 
href="#XvanAlphen:2001vc">10</a>], non-human primates [<a 
href="#XRobinson:1989wt">11</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XRobinson:1975vm">12</a>], and humans
[<a 
href="#XLeigh:2015ts">13</a>].
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   Previous attempts to understand how the integrator neurons transforms eye velocity signals to eye position signals have
relied on combining single-neuron electrophysiology with light-microscopic dye fills. Intracellular recordings in goldfish
hindbrain neurons that exhibited spiking correlated to eye position, followed by anatomical dye fills, show the axons of these
neurons send collaterals to areas where other integrator neurons were observed [<a 
href="#XAksay:2000cn">8</a>]. Similar anatomical observations have been
observed in cats [<a 
href="#XMcCrea:1985hx">14</a>] and nonhuman primates [<a 
href="#XSteiger:1979ev">15</a>]. These observations have shaped theoretical models to propose that
integration can be setup by recurrent excitation between these neurons [<a 
href="#XKamath:1976jm">16</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xseung_how_1996">17</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSeung:2000kl">18</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xfisher_modeling_2013">19</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgoncalves_optogenetic_2014">20</a>]. More recent imaging methods
have relied on two-photon calcium imaging to identify many integrator neurons followed by sparse, targeted single neuron
electroporation of fluorescent indicators for anatomical reconstruction [<a 
href="#XLee:2015dv">21</a>]. While these studies have delineated the
arborization and projection patterns of integrator neurons, they were limited to one or a few neurons in any individual brain
and do not reveal locations and the distributions of their input and output synapses. And although the axonal
projections could potentially synapse onto dendrites of other integrator neurons, conclusive evidence has been
lacking.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   We combined two-photon calcium imaging and serial electron microscopy to identify neurons in the neural integrator and
reconstruct the same neurons. We found evidence for multiple classes of neurons within the integrator population based on
differences in dendritic arborization, axonal projections and synaptic distributions. These include neurons with ipsilaterally
projecting axons at medial locations that are inferred to be excitatory, and neurons with contralaterally projecting axons at more
caudal locations that are inferred to be inhibitory. In addition, we found neurons at the lateral most edge of the volume, for
which we could not identify an axon, and a previously unreported integrator neuron with both ipsilateral and contralateral
axonal projections. We identified all chemical synapses in our images by the existence of presynaptic vesicles and postsynaptic
densities. Chemical synapses involving integrator neurons contained small vesicles, suggesting the presence of conventional
rather than peptidergic neurotransmitters. Finally we report evidence for direct synaptic connectivity between integrator
neurons.

<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >To identify putative integrator neurons we performed two-photon calcium imaging of the caudal hindbrain in a 6 dpf larval
zebrafish following bolus loading of the calcium sensor Oregon Green BAPTA 1-AM. The functional imaging was restricted to
one side where the loading was best and was performed on three planes that were ~8<span 
class="zptmcm7m-">&#x03BC;m </span>apart during spontaneous eye
movement. Calcium signals were correlated with eye position to identify integrator somata from the imaged planes (Fig. 1A)
[<a 
href="#XMiri:2011ft">22</a>]. Neurons were identified as integrator neurons if saccade-triggered eye position following an ipsiversive saccade (Fig.
1A,b arrow) was correlated with saccade-triggered average fluorescence (Fig. 1A,c first column) (Pearson coefficient <span 
class="zptmcm7m-">&#x003E; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">6</span>).
The integration time constants or the level of persistence was quantified as the time constant of an exponential fit to the firing
rate profile determined from a deconvolution of the fluorescence data (Fig. 1A, c, dotted line, extend methods). This resulted in
the identification of 22 integrator neurons from 3 distinct imaging planes with graded levels of persistence (Sup Fig. 1A,
B).
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   Following functional identification of integrator neurons, the tissue was optically imaged (LM), fixed, stained, sectioned for
serial electron microscopy and imaged at a final resolution of <span 
class="zptmcm7t-">5</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-">&#x00D7;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">5</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-">&#x00D7;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">45 </span>nm (RC, ML, DV) . These images were montaged and
aligned to create a 3D electron microscopy volume (EM) (Fig. 1B and Methods). The resulting EM volume extended ventrally
from the Mauthner cell axon plane by <span 
class="zptmcm7y-">~ </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">60</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-">&#x03BC;m</span>, caudally from the border of rhombomere 5/6 by <span 
class="zptmcm7y-">~ </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">200</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-">&#x03BC;m </span>and laterally from
the midline by <span 
class="zptmcm7y-">~ </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">100</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-">&#x03BC;m</span>. The LM and EM volumes were registered to each other by an affine transform, producing
correspondence of labeled neurons and blood vessels (Fig. 1C, Sup. Fig. 1C, Methods). The soma of all 22 integrator neurons
from the LM volume were located in the EM volume within the rhombomeres 6,7 and 8 (Fig 1D, colored by time
constants).

 id="x1-4000"></a>Stripe shaped patterning of somata in the hindbrain</h4>
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >Cell bodies in the hindbrain of the larval zebrafish follow a stereotypic stripe like pattern of alternating cell bodies and neuropil.
Cells within the same stripe typically share the same neurotransmitter identity, and morphology [<a 
href="#XHigashijima:2004cn">23</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKinkhabwala:2011eta">24</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKoyama:2011kl">25</a>]. To
extract this stripe like organization, we projected the locations of all cell somata (Fig. 1D, &#8217;o&#8217; symbol) from the
high-resolution imaged area onto a single plane. The high-res EM volume contained a total of 2967 somata spread
over rhombomeres 5 through 8 (Fig. 1D). The volume also contained well-known landmarks like the Mauthner
neuron [<a 
href="#XLee:1993ip">26</a>], the axon of the contralateral Mauthner neuron, neurons MiD2 and MiD3 of the reticulo-spinal
network [<a 
href="#XLee:1993ip">26</a>], and a number of commissural bundles (Fig. 1D). This procedure revealed an alternating pattern of
cell somata and neuropil. We were able to locate 3 peaks of cell somata, excluding a peak that corresponds to
neurons at the midline, each corresponding to a likely stripe (Fig. 1D, bottom panel, S1-3). The three stripes
were labeled based on their proximity to the midline, as medial (S1), intermediate (S2) and lateral stripe (S3)
respectively. <span id="textcolor1">The medial most stripe S1 aligns with a group of neurons that express the </span><span id="textcolor2"><span 
class="ptmri8t-">alx</span></span><span id="textcolor3"> transcription factor, that
also expresses glutamate. More dorsally, this stripe is laterally abutted by cells that express the </span><span id="textcolor4"><span

transcription factor which expresses glycine [<a 
href="#XKimura:2006hd">27</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKinkhabwala:2011eta">24</a>]. Previous work has show that at this depth (below the level of the
Mauthner axon) the vast majority of integrator neurons are not glycinergic [<a 
href="#XLee:2015dv">21</a>]. </span>The intermediate stripe S2
corresponds to neurons known to express the transcription factor <span 
class="ptmri8t-">dbx1b </span>[<a 
href="#XKinkhabwala:2011eta">24</a>]<span 
class="ptmri8t-">. </span>The majority of integrator neurons in
this stripe express GABA, while a small minority express glutamate. At the ventral locations explored here,
integrator neurons in this stripe are almost exclusively GABAergic [<a 
href="#XLee:2015dv">21</a>]. The lateral most peak S3 of neurons
corresponds with the expression of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-">barhl </span>transcription factor, which is also thought to be glutamatergic
[<a

<!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" >After the identification of the integrator neurons in the EM volume, we reconstructed all 22 integrator neurons and annotated

properties that were common to all integrator neurons.

rostrocaudal extent of the imaged volume. A subset of these neurons were located very close to the midline and at the
rostral edge of the imaged volume, close to the border of rhombomeres 6,7 and at the caudal end of the imaged
volume, located in rhombomere 8, roughly between myotomes 1, 2. Another subset of neurons was located at the
lateral end of the volume in rhombomere 8. The diameters of the integrator neurons were normally distributed,
with a mean of <span

the persistence level of the neurons, with larger neurons exhibiting higher degree of persistence (Sup. Fig. 1B

   <h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Synapses</h5>
<!--l. 251--><p class="noindent" >We annotated 320 presynaptic (green circles, Fig. 2) and 2195 postsynaptic sites (red circles, Fig. 2) on the 22 integrator
neurons. Synapses were identified by the presence of a presynaptic vesicle pool and an opposing postsynaptic density (PSD).
Synapses from or onto integrator neurons contained small vesicles, presumably containing a conventional neurotransmitter.
Elsewhere in the volume we did identify synapses with dense core vesicles, presumably containing a peptide neurotransmitter
(Sup. Fig. 2A). We were unable to differentiate synaptic membranes as <span 
class="ptmri8t-">symmetric </span>or <span 
class="ptmri8t-">asymmetric. </span>Symmetric synapses are
associated with many flat vesicles, instead at synapses we do not observe many vesicles that were flat. Similarly, rather than
observing a density that extended asymmetrically into the postsynaptic cell, we observe a presynaptic density (Sup. Fig.
2E).
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Integrator presynaptic sites</li></ul>
<!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" >The presynaptic site was generally at a varicosity in the axon with vesicles throughout. Opposing the postsynaptic density, a small,
denser cluster of vesicles was typically observed, along with the presynaptic density. These features are consistent with the idea
of a presynaptic active zone. The number of presynaptic sites on a neuron averaged <span

class="zptmcm7t-">2</span>. This is an underestimate of the
number of output synapses from an integrator neuron, because most axonal arbors were cut off by the borders of the volume. If
statistics are restricted to the 3 neurons that were more complete than others, there were <span

<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" >The postsynaptic densities were observed as a darkening of the membrane, indicative of more electron dense regions,
corresponding to more protein density. The number of postsynaptic sites on a neuron averaged <span

estimate of the number of input synapses to an integrator neuron, because most dendritic arbors were reconstructed in their

     <li class="itemize">Cell Junctions</li></ul>
<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >Along the somatic membrane, a darkening of the membrane interrupted by small gaps was often observed (Sup. Fig. 2B). The
darkening persisted over multiple serial sections, suggesting that it was not an artifact of tissue preparation or imaging. These

darkenings are some kind of cell junction. Although it has been shown that gap junctions exist in the developing larval zebrafish

<!--l. 311--><p class="noindent" >We defined axons as neurites with a) presynaptic vesicles or b) for cases where there were no presynaptic vesicles, define them
as putative axons using additional anatomical cues (addressed below). Regions of transition, from dendrite to axon, we termed
axon initiation sites. Example axon initiation sites are indicated in Fig. 2, showing the dendrite (neurite with red
postsynaptic sites) turning into axons at the axon initiation (open arrow). The main trunk of the axon extended
rostrally and ventrally (Fig. 2 A, B). From the main trunk emerged mediolateral branches, which we will term
collaterals. Those at the rostral extreme of the volume appeared to overlap with the expected location of the abducens
motor nucleus (based on its known position within rhombomere r5, 6 Sup. Fig. 3A ), with terminations in r4 as
well.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 325--><p class="indent" >   We observed sheaths around some axonal segments. In some locations, we saw that the sheath wrapped
around the axon a few times, loosely enough that cytoplasmic space was visible (Fig. 2A, EM panel). This was
consistent with the definition of loose myelin [<a 
href="#XCaley:1974fk">30</a>]. This is different from the more conventionally observed
compact myelin which appears as dark as seen elsewhere in the volume. The axon of the neuron in Fig. 2A was
intermittently loosely myelinated along its rostrocaudal section. Mediolateral collaterals emerged from the gaps in
loose myelin, and remained unmyelinated. Such loose myelin sheaths have been previously reported in goldfish
[<a

<!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   In 10/22 (45%) integrator neurons the presence of a contralaterally projecting putative axon was identified. Because neurites
in the contralateral hindbrain were not reconstructed, we relied on several other features for axon determination. First the
putative axons were devoid of any postsynaptic sites on the ipsilateral side (Fig. 2 B, D open arrow to end, no synapses). The
lack of postsynaptic sites on these putative axons is similar to the initial segment of conventional axons that were identified by
the presence of vesicles, where no presynaptic terminals in the proximal part of the axon were observed, and presynaptic sites
emerged only distally (Fig. 2B, initial segment of axon). Secondly, before crossing the midline, the putative axon
became engulfed by processes that appeared glial in nature (Fig. 2 C, D, EM inset G). The glial engulfment is
consistent with the idea of &#8216;glial bridges&#8216; that are instrumental in the guidance of axons during development
[<a 
href="#XBarresi:2005iw">32</a>]. Thirdly, these putative axons were thinner than the remaining neurites of the neuron. The diameter of
these putative axons were smaller to the other neurites and were similar to the diameters of conventional axons
(Sup. Fig. 1E). The mean axonal diameter was less than the mean dendrite diameter, conforming to the textbook
notion that axons are thinner than dendrites. These features were applied to determine a neurite to be a putative
axon.

<!--l. 513--><p class="noindent" >We combined two-photon calcium imaging from neurons in the larval zebrafish that were encoding for a behavioral
variable (eye-position) with serial section electron microscopy. This was done by registering the light microscopic
volume to the electron microscopic volume to locate the same neurons. We were able to reconstruct 22 integrator
neurons from the same animal, for which we had both functional and structural information. This procedure
revealed the existence of distinct groups of neurons that make up the ipsilateral integrator circuit. This included an
excitatory, ipsilaterally projecting group, an inhibitory, contralaterally projecting group and, a third, excitatory group
with unknown projections. Finally we provide the first conclusive evidence for synapses between integrator
neurons.
<!--l. 526--><p class="indent" >   Of the 22 integrator neurons, six, rostrally located neurons had exclusively ipsilaterally projecting axons.
All but one of these six neurons were medial to the first somata stripe S1, that is thought to contain mostly
excitatory, glutamatergic neurons. The axons and dendrites of these neurons display a planar organization, with
axons oriented approximately orthogonal to the dendrites (Sup. Fig. 4F). The majority of input synapses onto the
dendrites of these neurons lie along a plane approximately normal to the rostro-caudal (RC) axis. This suggests that
these neurons are setup to broadly sample from axons that are oriented along the RC axis. The axons of these
neurons are oriented along the RC axis with the rostral end more ventral than the caudal end. This suggests
that axons from this group can potentially synapse onto dendrites from this group. It has long been theorized
that positive feedback via recurrent excitation could be a possible mechanism that can explain long persistent
time scales of neuronal activity [<a 
href="#XSeung:2000kl">18</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xfisher_modeling_2013">19</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XJoshua:2013jg">35</a>]. Indeed, we observed conclusive chemical synapses from one
ipsilataterally projecting integrator neuron onto another ipsilaterally projecting integrator neuron. These facts
point to the ipsi group of neurons as a candidate that could support recurrent positive feedback in the integrator
circuit.
<!--l. 547--><p class="indent" >   The second major group of neurons that we reconstructed were the nine caudally located, contralaterally projecting
neurons. The somatic location of these neurons lie very close to the intermediate somal stripe S2, that are largely GABAergic
neurons. The dendrites of these neurons arborized over a smaller area, and stratify more dorsally as compared to the ipsi-only
group of neurons. The postsynaptic inputs on the dendrites of these cells lie along a plane that is approximately parallel to the
RC plane. This suggests that these neurons sample narrowly from inputs along the RC axis. In the goldfish oculomotor
integrator, contralaterally projecting neurons are thought to be involved in coordinating activity between the two
sides, where each side acts as an independent integrator [<a 
href="#XAksay:2007cv">36</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdebowy_encoding_2011">37</a>]. Although, we have not reconstructed the
contralateral side of the axons, evidence from light microscopic images of contralaterally projecting neurons
shows projections that terminate in the dendritic field of the opposing population of inhibitory integrator neurons
[<a 
href="#XLee:2015dv">21</a>].
<!--l. 564--><p class="indent" >   Of the remaining integrator neurons, one had both an ipsilateral and contralaterally projecting axon. The location of
its somata corresponded with the S2 stripe, which can be inferred as GABAergic. The remaining integrator
neurons were located at the lateral edge of the animal corresponding to the lateral most stripe S3 though to express
glutamate. Since these neurons are close to the edge of the imaged volume, in all cases, we were unable to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
trace many neurites from these cells. The axonal projection pattern and potential role of these neurons remains
unknown.
<!--l. 574--><p class="indent" >   Our evidence suggest that at least two of the groups, the ipsilaterally projecting and the contralaterally projecting
neurons are unique populations. They have significantly different dendritic morphologies, axonal projections and
distributions of postsynapses along their dendrites. The ipsi-only group of neurons has approximately twice as many
postsynaptic input sites as the contra-only only group. In both cases, initiation of the axons was from a neurite that
contained postsynaptic sites that then gave rise to presynaptic sites. This feature could be important to influence
the activity of neurons as these locations are proximal to the somata.<span id="textcolor7"> The integration time constants of these
neurons show graded levels of persistent activity. Time constants of contralaterally projecting neurons were
significantly different from the unknown projecting neurons, with the unknown projecting neurons showing faster
dynamics (Sup. Fig. 1D). Finally we note that distinguishing axons from dendrites using light microscopy can prove
erroneous, since the diameters of the axons and dendrites were very similar and close to the diffraction</span> limit of
light.
<!--l. 592--><p class="indent" >   Our sample of 22 reconstructed integrator neurons is a fraction of the roughly 100 integrator neurons estimated to exist on
one side of the larval zebrafish brain [<a 
href="#XAksay:2003un">38</a>]. We observed 6 chemical synapses from two ipsilaterally projecting integrator
neurons onto other integrator neurons. This observation may be an underestimate of integrator connectivity,
for a few reasons. First, there are many neurons in the imaged volume that carried no usable calcium signal
at all, largely because they did not take up enough calcium indicator. Some of these neurons are likely to be
integrator neurons overlooked by our study, and are potential postsynaptic partners of the reconstructed neurons in
our sample. Second, there are integrator neurons outside the imaged volume, and they could receive synapses
from our reconstructed integrator neurons. Only three axonal arbors were fully or mostly reconstructed; the
rest appeared substantially cut off as their axons left the volume, this is also evidenced by the fact that only
two of six ipsilaterally projecting axons project to the abducens motor nuclei, contrary to dye fill experiments,
where all ipsilateral axons project to the abducens. Third, we had no possibility of finding connections between
neurons on opposite sides of the brain, because only one side of the brain was imaged. Therefore, it is difficult to
know whether the two neurons that made synapses onto other integrator neurons are an exceptional case, or
representative of a larger population that was incompletely sampled. More definitive information about connectivity
patterns between integrator neurons awaits a future experiment with an imaged volume that is large enough to
encompass all integrator neurons, and a fluorescent calcium indicator that labels a higher percentage of integrator
neurons.
<!--l. 620--><p class="indent" >   Here we presented ultrastructural anatomical details of different types of integrator neurons and evidence of
synaptic connectivity between these neurons. Although we restricted our reconstructions to the unilateral integrator
circuit and consequently do not know about the postsynaptic targets of the contralaterally projecting axons, this
approach can be used to uncover general rules of connectivity and validate hypothesized theories of temporal
integration.

TCT0941- 025G) for about 1 minute and then quickly mounted dorsal side up with droplets of 1.7% low temperature agarose
(Sigma A0701-100G) on the lid of a 35mm petri dish containing a bed of hardened 1% agarose (Invitrogen 15510-027). The
larva was then covered in 50 mg/L MS222. The larva was bulk-loaded [<a 
href="#XBrustein:2003ef">39</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSmetters:1999jc">40</a>] with calcium sensitive dye Oregon Green 488
BAPTA-1 AM (5 mM, in DMSO with 5% pluronic, Invitrogen, O-6807) by inserting a capillary through the dorsal skin surface
over the lateral edge of the right side of the hindbrain just caudal to the cerebellum, at ~<span 
class="zptmcm7t-">30</span><sup><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-74">0</span></sup> decline relative to the dorsal
surface. Following recovery, the animal was immobilized in low melting agar and was positioned to view a
monitor with light gratings. The hindbrain of the animal was imaged at 790nm on predefined planes at 0.98 Hz.
The imaging was performed on three pre-defined planes <span

correlations for every pixel over a 5min acquisition period was determined for eye position and eye velocity. A
region-of-Interest (ROI) was then drawn over the pixels where the majority were correlated to one of these variables. The
fluorescence was reported as change in fluorescence for each frame to the average fluorescence, divided by the
average. Saccadic fluorescence traces were displayed over an 8 sec window starting 1 sec before the end of the
saccade. The firing rates were computed over a 6 second fixation period beginning 1 sec after the end of the
saccade. The firing rates were computed by deconvolving the average fluorescent traces with a calcium impulse
response function (CIRF) as described previously [<a 
href="#XMiri:2011ft">22</a>]. The integrator time constants were calculated by fitting
an exponential function (Matlab <span

<!--l. 812--><p class="noindent" >The animal was immersed in a fixative mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.25% glutaraldehyde buffered in
65 mM cacodylate buffer. The skin over the hindbrain was removed for good ultrastructure preservation and
homogeneous staining of the tissue. Then it was thoroughly washed in 0.1M cacodylate buffer with 4% sucrose before
staining. The tissue was stained using a conventional ROTO procedure [<a 
href="#XTapia:2012hs">43</a>]. Briefly, it was stained in 1% reduced
osmium tetroxide with potassium ferrocyanide for 2 hr on ice. It was then washed 4x 30 min in 0.1M cacodylate
buffer, also on ice. This was then followed by amplification in 1% sodium thiocarbohydroazide (TCH) for 15
min followed by 3x5 min washes in water and another round of incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr.
The tissue was then washed 3x15 min in water and incubated with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight. The
following day the tissue was washed 3x15 min in water and incubated for 30 min in Lead aspartate solution,
followed by washing and dehydrated with a series of ethanol, followed by propylene oxide (PO). The tissue was
then infiltrated in decreasing gradients of PO and EPON for 24 hrs and baked for 48 hrs at 60 C. Following
hardening, the tissue block face was coarsely trimmed and a rectangular mesa was defined for serial sectioning.
Care was taken to orient the specimen to permit sectioning along the horizontal axis. Serial sections from the
above animal were collected approximately from the level of the Mauthner axon at a thickness of 45 nm. The
serial sections were then adhered to a silicon wafer, using double sided carbon tape (TEDpella), the wafers
were coated with a thin film of carbon to make them conductive. The serial sections were collected using the
automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome (ATUM) [<a

emitting scanning electron microscope in the backscattered electron mode using a custom software interface to
collected the images [<a

were then registered in z using a similar approach, where the first pass was performed using affine transforms,
followed by elastic transforms. All the alignment was performed on a machine with 32 virtual cores and 120GB

<!--l. 858--><p class="indent" >   To locate the cells that were involved in the integrator circuit, we made use of the fact that large, gross morphological
features were easily identified in both the LM and EM stacks. Once enough such features were identified in the LM stack, we
located these same landmarks in the high-res EM stack. Each pair of landmarks (one from the LM volume and one from the
EM volume) was then used to calculate a global affine transform that was applied to transform the LM volume to be overlaid on
the EM volume using the TrakEM2 plugin in Fiji [<a

<!--l. 872--><p class="noindent" >The reconstruction of the identified neurons was performed using the TrakEM2 plugin in Fiji/ImageJ. One expert (AV) traced
all neurons and annotated all pre- and postsynaptic sites. AV noted difficult locations while tracing. A second expert (EA)
identified locations at which the skeletons looked unusual (sharp turns or closely spaced branch points). EA reviewed the
images at all of these locations (typically a few per neuron), and reached consensus with AV. At most locations the original
tracing of AV was judged correct. A few locations were judged ambiguous, in the sense that image defects made it
impossible to interpret the locations with certainty. At such ambiguous locations, we erred on the side of incomplete
tracing.
<!--l. 885--><p class="noindent" >A more detailed second round of tracing was then carried out using a more accurate semi-automated reconstruction method
similar to the &#8216;eyewire&#8217; platform (http://eyewire.org). This process involved semiautomatic reconstruction of neurons with two
tracers (not the authors), where the second tracer was able to view the first tracers reconstructions. A third expert tracer (A.V)
reviewed all sites where the first two tracers differed to provide consensus. The final trace included all those neurites where the
majority agreed. This ensures that each cells is covered by atleast 2 tracers. This semi-automated process revealed that the axon
of one cell was previously under-reconstructed and another dendrite from a different cell was over-reconstructed. The
remaining, vast majority 20/22 cells remained the same between both methods. Having real-time volume based tracing provides
shape based context to traces. This is useful to detect error. For example if a neurite is falsely mergerd it is oftern the case
that its diameter is different as compared to the neurite being reconstructed. Similarly, at locations where the
neurites are very thin, we can often reconstruct all the neurites abutting the neurite being traced to eliminate false
positives,
<!--l. 904--><p class="indent" >   Since the section thickness was 45nm, neurites that were parallel to the cutting plane were sometimes hard to follow during
reconstruction. This typically leads to problems when tracing very thin neurites (typically axons) that can be hard to follow. In
such instances is it useful to keep track of internal organells and other cues such as contrast to eliminate ambigious locations.
After such techniques are applied, the end result is that every cell has at most one or two truly ambiguous locations. The
ambiguity might be caused by a thin neurite parallel to the sectioning plane, or deteriorated ultrastructure (due to
electroporation, poor fixation, or possibly developmental pruning of axons). In truly ambiguous locations, we err on the side of
undertracing.
<!--l. 916--><p class="indent" >   The skeletonized tree structure was exported from TrakEM2 as *.swc files. These trees were then imported into Matlab
using custom scripts to import .swc files as trees. For the comparison of EM traces with LM traces, the LM traces were traced
using the Simple Neurite Tracer [<a 
href="#XLongair:2011hr">47</a>] plugin in Fiji, and exported as *.swc file. In total, we reconstructed 9.29 mm of neurite
(2.45 mm of axonal length and 6.84 mm of dendritic length).
<!--l. 924--><p class="indent" >   One neuron had axons with both ipsilateral and contralateral projections (Sup. Fig. 5A). This integrator neurons was located
more lateral to the neurons from <span 
class="ptmri8t-">ipsi-only group. </span>The ipsilaterally projecting axon resembled the axons of the ipsi-only group
of neurons (Fig. 3A), with similar tilt in the rostro-caudal axis. This neuron contained a neurite that crossed the midline. We
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
infer that this neurite is a putative contralaterally projecting axon based on the same cues that we use to identify other putative
axons.

<!--l. 935--><p class="noindent" >All tree lengths are reported as pathlengths unless noted otherwise. Similarly, all lengths to a pre- or postsynaptic site are
reported as pathlengths. We defined the axon initiation site as the parent node of the first presynaptic site. All neurites that are
not axonal are defined as dendritic. All nodes of the tree were thus divided as axonal nodes or dendritic nodes. Pathlengths were
generated for a tree over all axonal nodes or all dendritic nodes, and the length of the tree was the sum of all axonal length
and dendritic length. A <span 
class="ptmri8t-">collateral </span>was defined as all those segments of an axon, that emerged from the central
axonal shaft. All axonal nodes were divided into collateral and non-collateral nodes. The completeness of cells
was decided based on the number of neurites that exited the cells, the fewer that exited, the more complete the
cell,
<!--l. 949--><p class="indent" >   The diameter of the axon and dendrites for each tree was generated by drawing a line segment along the cross-section at
random locations along the tree. Many such line segments were drawn across the entire extent of the tree. The values are
reported as a mean across all dendrites and axons.
<!--l. 955--><p class="indent" >   Arbor densities of the dendrites was computed by projecting all the axonal or dendritic nodes along the desired plane and
reported in a normalized scale. Arbor volumes were computed using the Matlab function <span 
class="ptmri8t-">convhull</span>. To infer the
neurotransmitter identity from the stripe organization of the cell bodies, we annotated the location of all the cell
bodies from a low-resolution stack. The cell density was then computed by projecting all the cells along the
desired axis. This process picked out the peaks that were visible in the EM images. The location of a stripe was
defined as the local peak that emerged from the cell density projecting analysis. The planar organization of the
postsynapses and presynapses were fit to a plane using the <span 
class="ptmri8t-">planefit </span>function, available on the Matlab central
repository.
<!--l. 968--><p class="indent" >   To locate the border of r6/7 we followed a similar approach that was performed previous using light microscopic imaging
and the expression of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-">hox </span>genes [<a 
href="#XMa:2014gb">48</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XDaie:2015fd">42</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XLee:2015dv">21</a>]. Briefly reticulospinal cells were identified based on the ultrastructure, that
was very different form the remaining cells in the area. These cells were rich in mitochondria and gave rise to a large
myelinated axon that joined the remaining fibers along the midline. We fit a plane to the reticulospinal neurons, and identified a
point on this plane that bisected Mi3 neuron located in r6 and Ca neuron located in r7. The tilt of this border from previous
studies was observed to be <span 
class="zptmcm7t-">0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-">37</span>. This this line that bisected the locataions of Mi3 and Ca was moved <span

for every micron ventrally based on [<a 
href="#XDaie:2015fd">42</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XLee:2015dv">21</a>]. The resulting line is where we differetiate the border of r6 and
r7.
