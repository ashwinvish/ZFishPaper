Below are the detailed answers to the reviewers comments.
 The main concerns of the reviewer were from the lack of clarity in the
 methods that concern the reconstruction of neurons.
 Secondly, the reviewer also wondered about the ability to classify the
 synapses in this dataset based on techniques that are used for mammalian
 tissue.
 Some of the questions posed by the reviewers could not be assessed since
 this involved large amount of reconstructions.
 In short we have addressed the reviewers concerns and have made efforts
 to clarify the text to make the reconstruction methods lucid.
 We have also carried out additional analyses to attempt to classify the
 synapses based on conventions used for mammalian tissue.

Given the numerous postsynaptic input sites that were identified on the
 different morphological types, I was anticipating the authors would then
 proceed to reconstruct the presynaptic neurites.
 They did not.
 This was disappointing because I think a lot could be learned from such
 an effort.
 Such as: identification of additional putative integrator neurons that
 were not revealed by calcium imaging, identification of descending axons
 that presumable carry velocity information, an analysis of what fraction
 of inputs originate from different input types, etc..
 Again, I understand the limitations of the volume size, but some additional
 effort to gain more insight about the actual circuit connectivity within
 the integrator circuit would significantly strengthen the manuscript.

As we had indicated previously in our plan of action, the reviewer requested
 for anatomical reconstruction of all cell that were both Pre and Postsynaptic
 to the 22 integrator cells that were reconstructed in this study.
 This is approximately 3000 cells that would need to be reconstructed.
 This represents a 100X expansion of the current study.
 This is therefore outside the scope of this publication.
 Moreover integrator neurons cannot be identified by anatomy alone, and
 all physiologically identified integrator neurons in this study have been
 reconstructed.

Following on this point, the identification of just 6 synapses between the
 22 cells is a very low number.
 It begs for the not analyzed presynaptic cells to be traced and analyzed
 to the extent possible.
 Is there a theoretical prediction of the degree of connectivity needed
 to support positive feedback in the integrator circuit?

Like the above question, this question could only be answered by the detailed
 reconstruction of all cells that are synaptically connected to the 22 identifie
d cells.
 As was discussed in the plan of action, this is also out of the scope of
 this publication.

The authors found no substantial correlation between time constants and
 the variables they examined.
 Did they correlate time constants with synapse numbers/densities for each
 cell? Again, some idea of the fraction of synapses driven by descending
 inputs versus intra-hindbrain inputs would be interesting.

The reviewer has requested for the correlation of time constants to synapse
 numbers and densities.
 We have calculated and reported these correlation in the supplementary
 figures ( Sup.
 Fig.
 1B) along with the other variables that were previously reported.
 Both these analyses did not reveal a statistically significant difference
 in the .
 This is likely due to the small sample size of this study.

The second part of this question requests to compute the fraction of inputs
 onto the integrator neurons form other neurons within the hindbrain to
 outside the hindbrain.
 We agree with the reviewer that the results would be very interesting.
 However, to do this we would have to reconstruct all the neurons that are
 presynaptic to the integrator neurons.
 As we have mentioned previously, this is out of the scope of this publication.

The description of the tracing methodology is not sufficient to assess reliabili
ty.
 At a minimum the authors should expand on what the second round of tracing
 actually entailed and what exactly 'multiple coverage' means.

We apologize if our description of the tracing methodology was not sufficient.
 Our tracing was performed in two rounds.
 The first round was a skeleton based tracing that was performed using the
 open sourced software package TrakEM2.
 This process requires the placement of a point (or node) typically at the
 center of the neurite and to continue this process for the entire cell.
 This results in a `ball-and-stick' type model of the neuron.
 The problem with this arrangement when viewed in 3D is that it is hard
 to spot false positives.
 This is because reducing the neurites thickness to a single point removes
 any sense of scale.
 This contextual information is very useful to `catch' for example branches
 whose thickness do not match the thickness of the brach being traced indicating
 that it does not belong.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
To overcome some of the limitations of skeleton based tracing, we performed
 a second round of tracing where the cells were traced volumetrically.
 This method displays in real-time the branches being traced.
 This process did catch a few errors that slipped by the previous round
 of tracing (as mentioned in the methods).
 In order to have confidence in the traces, we required multiple tracers
 (>2) reconstructing the same cell, and final assessment by an expert tracers.
 This process is what we refer to as `multiple coverage'.
 We have now revised the text in the methods to make this process more clear
 (lines 569).

Did the authors find 45 nm section thickness to be sufficient to unambiguously
 trace all neurites? If so, they should explicitly state this because it
 would serve as a useful data point for the field.
 If not, the authors should quantify the prevalence of tracing ambiguities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention.
 Indeed there are some challenges associated with reconstruction neurons
 from sections that are cut at 45nm.
 The most common problem is when the neurite being reconstructed is parallel
 to the sectioning plane.
 This makes it hard to follow these neurites.
 At such locations, typically it helps to reconstruct all abutting neurites
 and converge on the parent neurite by the process of elimination.
 Another strategy is to keep track of the intracellular organelles to guide
 in the reconstruction.
 We have highlighted some these challenges in the methods section (line
 580).
 As was mentioned in the methods, of the 22 neurons, 2 neurons had problems
 in the axon reconstruction due to the anisotropy.
 These locations were subsequently recovered by having multiple tracers
 reconstruct at these locations.

Is there evidence that excitatory versus inhibitory synapses are ultrastructural
ly distinct in fish as is the claim in mammalian tissues (i.e.
 symmetric vs.
 asymmetric synapses)? Given the inference of transmitter type based on
 soma position, the authors could presumably at least look for differences
 that could help corroborate transmitter types.

As the reviewer had mentioned it is possible to differentiate synaptic membranes
 as either symmetric or asymmetric, depending on the side where the densities
 were more prevalent.
 Along with this observation, to aide this classification the shape of the
 vesicles are also considered.
 Typically asymmetric synapses are associated with spherical vesicles and
 are thought to be from excitatory cells.
 Whereas symmetric synapses have `flat' shaped vesicles and are associated
 with inhibitory cells.
 Similarly symmetric synapses have thin PSDs as compared to asymmetric synapses.
 In our dataset, it is very hard to observe any `flat', non-spherical vesicles.
 There are however large and small vesicles as has been noted in the main
 text.
 Regarding the postsynaptic density if there exits differences we should
 expect to see a large variation in the thickness of the PSD and a bi-modal
 like distribution of the thicknesses.
 Instead we find a normal distribution of PSD thicknesses and no real difference
 in the shape of the vesicles.
 We have reported these finding in the main text (line 114) and supporting
 analysis in supplementary figure 2E.
