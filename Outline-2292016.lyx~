unlike a reflex arc, where there is not much of a transformation of the
 input to the output, here we see that there is some degree of local computation
 that is happening, that is not purely reflex arc like.

The larval zebrafish is fast becoming a very promising vertebrate model
 organism for circuit based neuroscience.
 It offers the convenience of powerful genetic tools, well stocked mutant
 libraries and more importantly for circuit neuroscience, the ability to
 perform whole-brain imaging (Rainer review).
 The transparent brain of the larval zebrafish, coupled with genetic calcium
 based reporters and light-sheet microscopy, has allowed unprecedented ability
 to image from the whole brain (Arhens paper).

In order to tease apart circuits comprehensively, often researchers adopt
 a 'reverse-engineering' approach to determine the exact nature of the neuronal
 function to behavior.

\change_deleted 78966105 1457021197
One such tool that is often used in the c.elegans commiuinty is the connectome
 - the entire wring diagram of the worm (Bargmann papers).

Recent advances in high-throughput electron microscopy now allows us to
 integrate detailed anatomical features from physiologically recorded cells
 ( Brigmann papers etc.).

 the oculomotor circuit of the larval zebrafish
\change_inserted 78966105 1457021566
, using high-throughput electron microscopy techniques 
\change_unchanged
.
 We correlated functional light microscopic imaging with serial electron
 microscopy to reconstruct multiple neurons from the hindbrain of the larval
 zebrafish, which were specifically involved in the task of velocity-to-positon-
neural-integration (VPNI).
 We validated previous results, showing, that there are different classes
 of cells that make up the VPNI and observed a potential new class of cells,
 previously unknown, that had axonal projections ipsilaterally and contralateral
ly.
 These cell classes had varying dendritic arborization patterns and axonal
 projections.
 Axons of VPNI cells were observed to give rise to collaterals that overlapped
 with the dendritic field of other cells, suggesting the possibility of
 recurrent synaptic feedback between these cells.
 We were able to map the number of inputs and outputs and observed that
 on average there were three times more inputs as compared to outputs from
 these cells.
 Lastly, we answered a long standing question in systems neuroscience and
 observed that integrator cells are synaptically connected, specifically,
 cells from the same class synapses onto each other.
