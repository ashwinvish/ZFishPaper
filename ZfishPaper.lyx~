\begin_layout Abstract
Neural integrators are involved in a variety of sensorimotor and cognitive
 behaviors.
 The oculomotor system contains a simple example, a hindbrain neural circuit
 that takes velocity signals as inputs, and temporally integrates them to
 control eye position.
 We combined observations of behavior, physiology, and anatomy to study
 integrator neurons.
 To understand the mechanisms of integration, here we performed ultra-structural
 analysis of functionally-identified neurons located in the neural integrators.
 Two-photon calcium imaging of the larval zebrafish hindbrain was performed
 while simultaneously monitoring spontaneous eye movements.
 Integrator neurons were identified as those cells with activities highly
 correlated with eye position, and the same neurons were then reconstructed
 from serial electron microscopic images.
 Three major morphological classes of cells were observed: ipsilaterally
 projecting cells located medially and rostrally, contralaterally projecting
 cells located more laterally and caudally, and a population at the extreme
 lateral edge of the hindbrain for which we were not able to identify axons.
 Based on previous reports of correlation between somatic location and neurotran
smitter identity, we infer that cells with only ipsilaterally projecting
 axons are largely glutamatergic and excitatory, whereas cells with only
 contralaterally projecting axons are largely GABAergic and inhibitory.
 
\change_inserted 78966105 1467212575
Dendritic and synaptic organization of the ipsilaterally projecting cells
 suggest a broad sampling from inputs on the ipsilateral side.
 Finally, we 
\change_unchanged
observed the first conclusive evidence of synapses between integrator neurons,
 from an ipsilaterally projecting cell onto other cells.
 These results support the idea of integration through positive feedback

by recurrent excitation.

 the ultra-structure of cells that generate persistent firing in a hindbrain

.
 The neural integrator gets its name because the transformation of eye velocity
 into eye position is the computational operation of integration with respect
 to time.
 Integrator cells are operationally defined as premotor neurons that carry
 a horizontal eye position signal in their spiking.
 (There is also an integrator for vertical eye movements, but it will not
 be discussed here.) Integrator cells are thought to send their eye position
 signals through direct synapses onto extraocular motor neurons in the ipsilater
al abducens nucleus.
 They are also thought to receive signals from multiple convergent pathways
 that encode eye velocity for every type of eye movement.
 Therefore, the neural integrator is the

 We combined two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in a behaving fish to
 identify persistent firing cells in the neural integrator, with subsequent
 reconstructions of the same neurons using serial electron microscopy.
 The behavior is spontaneous eye movements, and the neurons are in a hindbrain

Previous attempts to understand how the integrator transforms a 'pulse'
 like input to a 'step' like output have relied on combining single-cell
 electrophysiology with light-microscopic dye fills.

 to identify many integrator neurons followed by sparse, targeted single
 cell electroporation of fluorescent indicators for anatomical reconstruction

.
 While these studies have delineated the arborization and projection patterns
 of integrator neurons, they were limited to one or a few neurons in any
 individual brain and do not reveal locations, distributions of synapses.
 And although, the axonal projections could potentially contact dendrites
 of other integrator neurons, conclusive evidence for contact and synapses
 has been lacking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We firmly demonstrate structure and fucntion links in the neural integrator
 by combined two-photon calcium imaging of integrator neurons during spontaneous
 eye movements, with subsequent reconstructions of the same neurons using
 serial electron microscopy.
 We found evidence for multiple classes of cells within the integrator populatio
n based on differences in arborization, projections and synaptic densities.
 These classes of cells include cells with ipsilaterally projecting axons,
 identified by the existence of presynaptic boutons containing vesicles,
 cells with only contralaterally projecting axons.
 In addition, we found cells at the lateral most edge of the volume, for
 which we could not identify an axon and a small subset of previously unreported
 integrator neurons with axonal arbors that were both ipsilateral and contralate
ral.
 We identified chemical synapses in our images by the existence of presynaptic
 vesicles and postsynaptic densities.
 All chemical synapses involving integrator neurons contained small vesicles,
 suggesting the presence of conventional rather than peptidergic neurotransmitte
rs.
 We inferred the neurotransmitter identity of the cells, based on the organizati
on of cell somata in the hindbrain into 'stripes' that correspond to the
 neurotransmitter identity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Higashijima:2004cn,Kinkhabwala:2011et,Koyama:2011kl"

\end_inset

.
 On this basis, we inferred that integrator neurons with only ipsilaterally
 projecting axons are glutamatergic, and those with only contralaterally
 projecting axons are GABAergic.
 Finally we report evidence for synaptic connectiveity between integrator
 neurons with ipsilaterally-projecting axons and between ipsilateral and
 contralateral projecting axons.

Our work is the first application of this approach to a population of neurons
 defined by their encoding of behavioral variables, rather than stimulus
 variables.

\begin_layout Subsection
Combined two-photon and electron microscopy of integrator neurons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify putative integrator neurons we performed two-photon calcium
 imaging of the caudal hindbrain in a x dpf larval zebrafish following bolus
 loading of the calcium sensor Oregon Green BAPTA 1-AM.
 [describe imaging plane specs here, focused on left side where loading
 was best].
 Following functional imaging, we imaged the entire hindbrain of the animal
 with optical sections that were 1 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m apart, producing a light microscopic volume (LM volume).
 Calcium signals were correlated with eye position to identify integrator
 somata from the imaged planes (Fig.
 1A) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Miri:2011ft"

\end_inset

.
 Cells were identified as integrator neurons if saccade-triggered average
 fluorescence was correlated strongly with saccade-triggered eye position
 following an ipsiversive saccade (Fig.
 1A - b, arrow) (Pearson coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.6$
\end_inset

), the cell was identified as an integrator neuron (Fig.
 1A - b).
 This resulted in the identification of 22 integrator cells from 3 distinct
 imaging planes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen by the average of the fluorescence response (Fig.
 1A- c), these cells have distinct, graded persistent activity during eye
 fixation.
 This persistent activity was quantified with a persistent firing metric,
 calculated as the area under an exponential fit to the firing rate profile
 determined from a deconvolution of the fluorescence data (methods).

\change_deleted 187266875 1466190733
 
\change_inserted 187266875 1466190733
 Overall, we observed that cells that were nearer to each other have similar
 persistence levels with cells at caudal locations having slightly higher
 persistence levels as compared to cells at rostral locations ( Sup.
 Fig.
 1A ).
 
\change_unchanged
As observed previously, the degree of persistent firing was distributed
 over a wide range (Figure 1A

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After functional identification of neural integrator cells, the tissue was
 fixed and sectioned for serial electron microscopy, imaged at 5x5x45nm
 resolution.
 These images were stitched and aligned to create a 3D electron microscopy
 volume (EM) that was registered with the LM volume.
 (Fig.
 1B and Methods).
 The resulting EM volume extended ventrally from the Mauthner cell axon
 plane by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim60\mu m$
\end_inset

, caudally from the border of rhombomere 5/6 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim200\mu m$
\end_inset

 and laterally from the midline by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100\mu m$
\end_inset

.
 The LM and EM volumes were registered to each other by an affine transform,
 producing correspondence of labeled cells and blood vessels (Fig.
 1C).
 The soma of all 22 integrator cells from the LM volume were located in
 the EM volume within the rhombomeres 6,7 and 8 (Fig 1D).
 This procedure revealedthree loosely organized groups of cells (addressed
 later) in the imaged volume.
 Overlaying the persistence 'level' of integrator cells revealed these groups
 to have cells with a large range of persistence levels.

\begin_layout Subsection
Inferring neurotransmitter identity of integrator neurons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We attempted to infer neurotransmitter identity of the identified integrator
 cells based on their somatic locations.
 Cell bodies in the hindbrain of the larval zebrafish follow a stereotypic
 alternating stripes pattern of cell bodies and neuropil.
 Cells in the same stripe largely share the same neurotransmitter identity,
 and morphology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Higashijima:2004cn,Kinkhabwala:2011et,Koyama:2011kl"

\end_inset

.
 We projected the locations of all cell somata (Fig.
 1D, '+' symbol) from the imaged area onto a single plane and noticed the
 emergence of alternating peaks of cell somata and neuropil, reminiscent
 of the stripe like pattern.
 We were able to locate 3 peaks, each corresponding to a likely stripe (Fig.
 1D, bottom panel).
 Based on this, we inferred the putative neurotransmitter identity of the
 integrator cells.
 The medial most peak on the ipsilateral side overlaps with cells that were
 shown to express the

transcription factor, and are mostly glutamatergic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Cells in this peak were previously shown to almost exclusively contain
 glutamatergic integrator cells

\begin_layout Subsection
Anatomical properties of integrator cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the identification of the integrator cells in the EM volume, we then
 reconstructed all 22 cells and annotated the synaptic locations for all
 cells.
 We first characterized some of the anatomical properties that were common
 to all integrator cells.
 The high-res EM volume contained a total of 2967 somata spread over rhombomeres
 5 through 8 ( Fig.
 1D).
 The volume also contained well-known landmarks like the Mauthner cell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the axon of the contralateral Mauthner cell, cells MiD2 and MiD3 of the
 reticulo-spinal network

, and a number of commissural bundles (Fig.
 1D).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Somata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The soma locations of the 22 integrator cells ended up in three 
\change_inserted 78966105 1466610409
loosely observed groups
\change_unchanged
.
 These cells were distributed over ~23 µm in the dorsoventral axis and the
 entire rostrocaudal extent of the imaged volume.
 The first 
\change_inserted 78966105 1466610452
group
\change_unchanged
 of cells was located very close to the midline and at the rostral edge
 of the imaged volume, very close to the border of r

\change_unchanged
6,7 The second 
\change_inserted 78966105 1466610469

 the first group of cells, located in r
\change_inserted 78966105 1466610487

8, roughly between myotomes 1,2.
 A third loose

 of cells was located at the lateral end of the volume in r

 (Fig.
 1D
\change_inserted 78966105 1466610514
, colored circles
\change_unchanged
).
 The diameters of the integrator cells were normally distributed, with a
 mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.5\pm0.6\:\mu m$
\end_inset

 (mean ± standard deviation).
 In general, the size of the somata was proportional to the persistence
 level of the cells
\change_inserted 78966105 1466610612
, with larger cells exhibiting higher degree of persistence (Sup.
 Fig.
 1B)
\change_unchanged
.
 On average 
\begin_inset Formula $3.3\pm1.5$
\end_inset

 neurites emerged from the somata, and traveled ventrally.
 Some neurites exited the imaged volume, leading to incompletely reconstructed
 cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Synapses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We annotated 406 presynaptic (green circles, Fig.
 2) and 2229 postsynaptic sites (red circles, Fig.
 2) on integrator neurons.
 Synapses were identified by the presence of a presynaptic vesicle pool
 and an opposing postsynaptic density.
 Synapses from or onto integrator neurons contained small vesicles, presumably
 containing a conventional neurotransmitter.
 Elsewhere in the volume we did identify synapses with dense core vesicles,
 presumably containing a peptide neurotransmitter (Sup.
 Fig.
 2A).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Integrator postsynaptic sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The postsynaptic densities were observed as a darkening of the membrane,
 indicative of more electron dense regions.
 The number of presynaptic sites on a cell averaged 
\begin_inset Formula $58\pm44.39$
\end_inset

.
 This is an underestimate of the number of output synapses from an integrator
 neuron, because most axonal arbors were cut off by the borders of the volume.
 
\change_inserted 78966105 1466692167
If statistics are restricted to the 3 cells that were more complete than
 others, there were

\end_inset

 postsynaptic sites.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Integrator presynaptic sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presynaptic site was generally at a varicosity in the axon with vesicles
 throughout.
 Opposing the postsynaptic density, a small, denser cluster of vesicles
 was typically observed, along with the presynaptic density.
 These features are consistent with the idea of a presynaptic active zone.
 The number of postsynaptic sites on a cell averaged 
\begin_inset Formula $101\pm74$
\end_inset

.
 This is a reasonable estimate of the number of input synapses to an integrator
 neuron, because most dendritic arbors were reconstructed in their entirety.

 presynaptic sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tight Junctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along the somatic membrane, a darkening of the membrane interrupted by small
 gaps was often observed (Sup.
 Fig.
 2B).
 The darkening persisted over multiple serial sections, suggesting that
 it was not an artifact of tissue preparation or imaging.
 We speculate that these darkenings are tight junctions, or electrical synapses,
 which are known to exist in the developing larval zebrafish hindbrain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Jabeen:2013fm"

\end_inset

.
 These darkenings were visible between somata of integrator-integrator and
 integrator-non-integrator cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dendrites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dendrites were defined by the absence of presynaptic vesicles and the presence
 of postsynaptic densities.
 They were mostly oriented ventral to the location of the somata.
 Dendrites were smooth rather than spiny.
 The dendritic arbors of these cells fell into a distribution with a long
 tail, see distribution of arbor size (Sup.
 Fig.
 1).
 Cells with small arbors were completely reconstructed and did not have
 any dendrites that exited the imaged volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Axons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined axons as neurites with presynaptic vesicles.
 No axons were observed emerging directly from the cell body.
 Instead, dendrites bearing postsynaptic sites turned into axons with presynapti
c sites.
 This region of transition, form dendrite to axon, we termed axon initiation
 site.
 Example axon initiation sites are indicated in Fig.
 2, showing the dendrite (neurite with red postsynaptic sites) turning into
 axons at the axon initiation (open arrow) .
 The main trunk of the axon extended rostrally and ventrally (Fig.
 2 A,B,C).
 From the main trunk emerged mediolateral branches, which we will term collatera
ls.
 Those at the rostral extreme of the volume appeared to overlap with the
 expected location of the abducens motor nucleus (based on its known position
 within rhombomere r5,6 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Show in sup figure
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 In total, we reconstructed 1.62 mm of axonal length in the imaged volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed dark sheaths around some axonal segments.
 In some locations, we saw evidence that the sheath wrapped around the axon
 multiple times (Fig.
 2A, EM panel), so we inferred that the axons were loosely myelinated, as
 compared to the thick dark myelin that is seen elsewhere in the volume.
 The axon of the cell in Fig.
 2A was intermittently loosely myelinated along its rostrocaudal section.
 Mediolateral collaterals emerged from the gaps in loose myelin, and remained
 unmyelinated.
 Loose myelin sheaths have been previously reported in goldfish

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Small protuberances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small fraction (3% or 89/2229) of the postsynaptic sites were located
 on finger-like projections from dendrites that were enveloped by invaginations
 of axonal boutons (Fig.
 2B, EM panel 2).
 These projections resemble structures found across multiple species called
 spinules, and are thought to be present on large, active synapses

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting feature observed on all integrator cells was a the presence
 of a primary cilia in all the 22 integrator cells.
 This cilium, typically 
\begin_inset Formula $<1$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m, is enriched with microtubules, and emerges from the cell body very close
 to the Golgi complex.
 In some cases, this primary cilium terminated inside processes that were
 presumed glial (Sup.
 Fig.
 3A).
 Orientation of primary cilium in integrator cells did not show any orientation

Putative axons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some of the integrator cells the putatice axons were identified.
 All putative axons crossed the midline at locations ventral to the somata.
 They were identfied not based on the presence of vesicles opposed to post-synap
tic densities, instead they were identified by non-conventional anatomical
 features.
 The features were as follows, firstly the putative axons were devoid of
 any postsynaptic sites on the ipsilateral side.
 Secondly, before crossing the midline, the putative axon became engulfed
 by processes that appeared glial in nature (Fig.
 2 C,D).
 Thirdly, these putative axons were smaller than the remaining neurites
 of the cell.
 These are features typical of axons.
 The lack of presynaptic sites on these putative axons is similar to the
 initial segment of axons that were identified by the presence of vesicles,
 where no presynaptic terminals in the proximal part of the axon were observed,
 and presynaptic sites emerged only distally.
 The glial engulfment is consistent with the idea of glial bridges that
 are instrumental in the guidance of axons during development

\end_inset

.
 Finally, the diameter of these puative axons were smaller to the other
 nuerites and were similar to the diameters of conventional axons (Sup.
 Fig.
 1C).
 The mean axonal diameter was less than the mean dendrite diameter, conforming
 to the textbook notion that axons are thinner than dendrites (addressed
 later).
 All but one integrator cell with contralaterally projecting putative axons
 did not emerge from the somata of the cell.
 Instead, the initial zone of the putative axon contained postsynaptic sites
 (Fig.
 2 C,D - postsynaptic sites before putative axon).
 Furthermore, since neurite diameters are close to the diffraction limit,
 light microscopic estimation of neurite diameters could be inaccurate.

 The ipsilateral projections resembled the axons of ipsi-only group cells

 We infer that this neurite is a putative contralaterally projecting axon.
 This cannot be confirmed with certainty, because its presynaptic sites

 Our inference is based on a number of cues as mentioned previously.
 In both cases, the midline cross-over happened at locations that were ventral

 Like the axons in the ipsi-only group, the putative contralateral axons
 did not emerge as axons, but started as a neurite with postsynaptic sites,
 that became axonal.
 However, unlike the ipsi-only group, the axon initiation site was much
 closer to the somata.
 On average, the axon initiation site was

 For these cells we did not find any neurites with presynaptic sites nor

 We believe this is most likely because these cells were not fully represented
 in the imaged volume and neurites of these cells exit the volume before
 the axon was located.

 We then computed the pathlengths of each synaptic location form the somta

We further computed the synaptic density, the number of synapses per unit
 length for all cells, with the assumption that the synapses within each
 group were uniformly distributed along dendrites.
 The uniformity assumption was made because the distributions of the locations
 of postsynapses was found to closely match the location of dendritic arbors
 (Sup.

 We found that the average the ipsi.

\begin_inset Formula $2.6\pm1.2$

 postsynaptic sites (inputs) every micron, where as the `contra' group of

 postsynaptic sites (inputs) every micron (Fig.

\begin_inset Formula $p=0.059,$

 These differences in synaptic densities is not due to differences in lengths
 of the dendrites, but reflects actual differences in the underlying location
 of postsynaptic sites along the dendrites.
 Emperically the average intersynaptic distance for the `ipsi' and `contra'
 groups of cells are

The dendrites of the cells form the ipsi and contra groups were observed
 to lie along orthogonal planes.
 The dendrites of the cells in the ipsi groups were noticed to like roughly
 aling a coronal plane with some tilt (Fig.
 3A).
 Similarly, the dendrites of the cells in the contra cells were noticed
 to exhibit some planar orgnization as well.
 Fittting a plane through the postsynaptic sites that lie along the dendrites
 of the cells in the ipsi and contra groups revealed that these plane were
 nearly orthognoal (

The dendrites arbors of the cells in these two groups displayed an inversion

 The dendritic arbors of the ipsi cells peaked a at a depth of

 Whereas for the contra group the peak stratification depth was around

 Interestingly,

Connectivity between integrator neurons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also examined the patterns of connectivity between integrator neurons.
 We found that there exists overlap of the axons of the ipsilaterally projecting
 cells (Sup.
 Fig.
 5B, green) with the dendrites of all other cells in the volume (Sup.
 Fig.
 5B, red).
 More specifically, the overlap at ventro-rostral locations seems to be
 from axons of ipsi-cells onto dendrites of other ipsi-cells, where as the
 overlap at dorso-caudal locations seem to be from axons of ipsi-cells onto
 dendrites of contra-cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there was notable overlap in the axonal and dendritic fields,
 when looked at in finer resolution we found that there were very few locations
 where axo-dendritic contacts were made.
 From the axon collaterals of one integrator cell, we found the hypothesized
 synapses onto other integrator cells.
 This single cell belonged to the 
\emph on

 group.
 It made 2 synapses onto another 
\emph on

 A total of eight cells (

 Based on this projection pattern, it might appear that all eight cells
 had the

 to make synapses onto other integrator neurons within the confines of the
 imaged volume.
 However, this would be overstating the case if the axons failed to even

 Therefore we decided to define a

 We found 48 potential synapses between integrator cells (Fig.

 Of this set, 40 involved the one cell that made the four real synapses

 Therefore this cell seemed exceptional in that it made a disproportionate
 number of potential synapses as well as all the real synapses.
 This number dropped substantially if the cell was randomly translated by

Here we detailed an approach where we recorded from cells in the larval
 zebrafish that were encoding for a behavioral variable, in this case eye-positi
on, followed by registering the light microscopic images to an electron
 microscopic volume to locate the same cells.
 We were able to reconstruct 22 integrator cells for whcih we had both function
 and structure.
 This procedure revealed the existance of distinct groups of cells that
 make up the ipsiliateral integrator circuit.
 By inferring the neurotransmitter identity of the cells, we show that there
 are at least two distinct groups of cells in the integrator circuit.
 An excitatory, ipsiliaterally projecting population and an inhibitory contralat
erally projecting polulation.
 We also find evidence for a third, new, ipsilateral and contralaterlly
 projecting polulation.
 Finally we provide the first conclusive evidence for synapses between integrato
r neurons.
 This high-throughput approach can be extented to multiple cells in the
 same animal, to provide rich functional and structural information from
 multiple cells to understand neural circuits in organisms.

It has long been theorized that positive feedback could be a mechanism that
 can explain long persistent time scales of neuronal activity.
 
\change_inserted 78966105 1467213116
Here we present evidence that the 'ipsi' group of cells in this study is
 a strong candidate that can setup positive feedback.
 The somata of almost all the neurons in the ipsi group lie within close
 to the medial most peak of cell somata, making them most likely excitatory.
 The axons and dendrites of these cells display a planar organization.
 The majority of its input synapses lie along a plane approximately normal
 to the rostro-caudal axis.
 This suggests that these cells are setup to broadly sample from axon that
 traverse the RC axis.
 This fact is also evident in the projection pattern of the axons from this
 group of cells.
 Its axons travel along the RC axis, and its output synapses lie along a
 plane approximately normal to its dendrites (Sup.
 Fig).
 Finally, we also observed conclusive chemical synapses from one ipsilataterally
 projecting integrator cell onto another ipsilaterally projecting integrator
 cell.
 These facts point to the ipsi group of cells as the most likely candidate
 for establishing positive feedback in the integrator circuit.

 In our study, the contralaterally projecting neurons were located in a
 loose group at the caudal extent of the imaged volume.
 The somatic location of these neurons correspond very closely to the intermedia
te peak of somata, that are largely GABAergic.
 The dendrities of these neurons arborized over a smaller area, and were
 stratified more dorsally as compared to the ipsi cells.
 Although, we observed chemical synapses from one ipsilateral neurosn onto
 two conrtalateral nerons, the planar organization of all the postsynapses
 (inputs) onto these cells was orthogonal to the inputs on the ipsilateral
 neurons.
 This suggests that theses cells sample narrowly form axons along the RC
 axis and that infact the they are two independent populations of neurons.

 Eight of the reconstructed cells had ipsilaterally projecting axons.
 Of these, only one cell made synapses onto other reconstructed integrator
 neurons.
 If the observed synapses are representative of the entire population, this
 suggests the integrator population contains a subset of cells are well-connecte
d with each other.
 While the remaining cells may serve to communicate eye-position related
 information to other brain areas

 On the other hand, this observation may be an underestimate of integrator
 connectivity, for a few reasons.
 First, there are many cells in the imaged volume that carried no usable
 calcium signal at all, largely because they did not take up enough calcium
 indicator.
 Some of these cells are likely to be integrator neurons overlooked by our
 study, and are potential postsynaptic partners of the reconstructed cells
 in our sample.
 Second, there are integrator neurons outside the imaged volume, and they
 could receive synapses from our reconstructed integrator neurons.
 (Only three axonal arbors were fully or mostly reconstructed; the rest
 appeared substantially cut off as their axons left the volume.) Third, we
 had no possibility of finding connections between neurons on opposite sides
 of the brain, because only one side of the brain was imaged.
 Therefore, it is difficult to know whether the single cell that made synapses
 onto other integrator neurons is an exceptional case, or a representative
 of a larger population that was incompletely sampled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our evidence also suggest that at least two of the groups, the ipsilaterally
 projecting and the contralaterally projecting neurons are unique populations.
 They have significantly different morphologies, dendritic arbors and axonal
 projections patterns.
 Although the density of postsynapses along the dendrites is the same, the
 distributions of these postsynapses are significantly different.
 The ipsi-only group of cells had twice as many postsynaptic sites as the
 contra-only only group.
 Similarly, the emergence of the axon in the ipsi-only group, is much farther
 as compared to the contra-only group.
 This feature could be important to influence the cells, since these locations
 are most proximal to the somata.
 What remains unknown are the presynaptic partners of these cells, and how
 do they influence the function of the integrator cell, whether and if there
 are preferred locations on the dendrite from specific cells.
 More definitive information about connectivity patterns between integrator
 cells awaits a future experiment with an imaged volume that is large enough
 to encompass all integrator cells, and a fluorescent calcium indicator
 that labels a higher percentage of integrator cells.

 Briefly, a stack was acquired over the same imaging window, with optical

 Once this was performed, the animal was anesthetized and the skin over

 the animal was immersed in fixative to preserve the ultrastructure.
 We found that the removal of the skin over the hindbrain was important

 The EM volume we imaged contained 15791 image tiles (8K x 8K pixels each)
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{11}$
\end_inset

 pixels (Fig.
 1B).
 These images were registered using the trakEM2 plugin in Fiji (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cardona:2012kf"

\end_inset

).
 Briefly, individual images were first montaged using affine transforms
 followed by elastic transforms.
 Following this they were aligned in the z dimension, using first, affine
 and followed by elastic transforms.

Reconstructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstruction of the cells was performed using the TrakEM2 plugin in
 Fiji/ImageJ.
 Two expert tracers reconstructed the cells beginning from the cell bodies
 in an independent manner.
 During the tracing process, one of the expert tracers annotated all pre
 and postsynaptic sites for each cells.
 The skeletonized tree structure was exported from TrakEM2 as *.swc files.
 These trees were then imported into Matlab using custom scripts to import
 .swc files and maintain them as trees.
 The traces of the two tracers were compared by a third reviewer.
 The third reviewer, independently reviewed points of disagreement and decided
 which points of disagreement were either over-reconstructed or were under-recon
structed.
 In some cases, the traces were re-visited by the tracers if it was needed.
 For the comparison of EM traces with LM traces, the LM traces were traced
 using the Simple Neurite Tracer (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Longair:2011hr"

\end_inset

) plugin in Fiji, and exported as a *.swc file.
 They were then imported into the same Matlab framework that was used to
 analyze the EM traces, and used to compute necessary features to compare
 the LM traces and the EM traces.
 The total length of all reconstructed neurites in the imaged volume was
 9.55 mm.
 In some cases, the neurite of the cells exited the volume and were thus
 under reconstructed.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All analysis was performed on Matlab using custom scripts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the degree of completeness of the cells that were reconstructed,
 we compared the EM reconstructions of the cells with the long-range axons
 to previously reported LM reconstructions of similar neurons (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lee:2015dv"

\end_inset

).
 We did not observe any significant difference in the total number of axonal
 collaterals and the length of these collaterals (Sup.
 Fig.
 4D,E,F).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate the reliability of such inferences, we quantified the caliber
 of our axons and dendrites.
 For 20 out of 22 cells, the mean axonal diameter was less than the mean
 dendrite diameter, conforming to the textbook notion that axons are thinner
 than dendrites (addressed later).
 However, the axon was thicker than the dendrites for the remaining two
 cells, so inference of neurite identity based on caliber would have been
 erroneous for these cells.
