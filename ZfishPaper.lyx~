\begin_layout Abstract
Neural integrators are involved in a variety of sensorimotor and cognitive
 behaviors.
 The oculomotor system contains a simple example, a hindbrain neural circuit
 that takes velocity signals as inputs, and temporally integrates them to
 control eye position.
 We combined observations of behavior, physiology, and anatomy to study
 integrator neurons.
 Two-photon calcium imaging of the larval zebrafish hindbrain was performed
 while simultaneously monitoring spontaneous eye movements.
 Integrator neurons were identified as those neurons with activities highly
 correlated with eye position, and the same neurons were then reconstructed
 from serial electron microscopic images.
 Three morphological classes of neurons were observed: ipsilaterally projecting
 neurons located medially, contralaterally projecting neurons located more
 laterally and a population at the extreme lateral edge of the hindbrain
 for which we were not able to identify axons.
 Based on their somatic locations, we infer that neurons with only ipsilaterally
 projecting axons are glutamatergic, whereas neurons with only contralaterally
 projecting axons are largely GABAergic.
 Dendritic and synaptic organization of the ipsilaterally projecting neurons
 suggest a broad sampling from inputs on the ipsilateral side.
 We also observe the first conclusive evidence of synapses between integrator
 neurons, which have long been hypothesized by recurrent network models
 of integration via positive feedback.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Combining two-photon calcium imaging with serial electron microscopy (EM)
 is an emerging approach for studying the structure and function of neural
 circuits at cellular resolution.
 In the mouse retina

 and primary visual cortex 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bock:2011fk,Lee:2016ti"

\end_inset

, this approach has been used to study the structure and function of visual
 neurons.
 Here we apply this approach to a population of neurons defined by their
 encoding of behavioral variables, rather than stimulus variables.
 Namely, we focus on neurons that carry eye position signals that are located
 in a hindbrain neural circuit known as the "velocity-to-position neural
 integrator," or "neural integrator" for short

 behavior

\begin_layout Standard
The neural integrator gets its name because the transformation of eye velocity
 into eye position is the computational operation of integration with respect
 to time.
 Integrator neurons are operationally defined as premotor neurons that carry
 a horizontal eye position signal in their spiking (there is also an integrator
 for vertical eye movements, but it will not be discussed here).
 Integrator neurons are thought to send their eye position signals to extraocula
r motor neurons through monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways.
 They are also thought to receive inputs from multiple convergent pathways
 that encode eye velocity for every type of eye movement.
 Therefore, the neural integrator is the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous attempts to understand how the integrator neurons transforms eye
 velocity signals to eye position signals have relied on combining single-neuron
 electrophysiology with light-microscopic dye fills.
 Intracellular recordings in goldfish hindbrain neurons that exhibited spiking
 correlated to eye position, followed by anatomical dye fills, show the
 axons of these neurons to send collaterals to areas where other integrator
 neurons were observed

 Similar anatomical observations have been observed in cats

 and nonhuman primates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 These observations have shaped theoretical models to propose that integration
 can be setup by recurrent excitation between these neurons

 More recent imaging methods have relied on two-photon calcium imaging to
 identify many integrator neurons followed by sparse, targeted single neuron
 electroporation of fluorescent indicators for anatomical reconstruction
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 While these studies have delineated the arborization and projection patterns
 of integrator neurons, they were limited to one or a few neurons in any
 individual brain and do not reveal locations and the distributions of their
 input and output synapses.
 And although the axonal projections could potentially synapse onto dendrites
 of other integrator neurons, conclusive evidence has been lacking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We combined two-photon calcium imaging and serial electron microscopy in
 a behaving fish to identify neurons in the neural integrator and reconstructed
 the same neurons.
 We found evidence for multiple classes of neurons within the integrator
 population based on differences in dendritic arborization, axonal projections
 and synaptic distributions.
 These include neurons with ipsilaterally projecting axons at medial locations
 that are inferred to be excitatory, and neurons with contralaterally projecting
 axons at more caudal locations that are inferred to be inhibitory.
 In addition, we found neurons at the lateral most edge of the volume, for
 which we could not identify an axon, and a small subset of previously unreporte
d integrator neurons with both ipsilateral and contralateral axonal projections.
 We identified all chemical synapses in our images by the existence of presynapt
ic vesicles and postsynaptic densities.
 Chemical synapses involving integrator neurons contained small vesicles,
 suggesting the presence of conventional rather than peptidergic neurotransmitte
rs.
 Finally we report evidence for direct synaptic connectivity between integrator
 neurons.

\begin_layout Subsection
Combined two-photon and electron microscopy of integrator neurons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify putative integrator neurons we performed two-photon calcium
 imaging of the caudal hindbrain in a 6 dpf larval zebrafish following bolus
 loading of the calcium sensor Oregon Green BAPTA 1-AM.
 The functional imaging was restricted to one side where the loading was
 best and was performed on three planes that were ~8
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m$
\end_inset

 apart during spontaneous eye movement.
 Calcium signals were correlated with eye position to identify integrator
 somata from the imaged planes (Fig.
 1A) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Miri:2011ft"

\end_inset

.
 Neurons were identified as integrator neurons if saccade-triggered eye
 position following an ipsiversive saccade (Fig.
 1A,b arrow) was correlated with saccade-triggered average fluorescence
 (Fig.
 1A,c first column) (Pearson coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.6$
\end_inset

).
 The integration time constants or the level of persistence was quantified
 as the time constant of an exponential fit to the firing rate profile determine
d from a deconvolution of the fluorescence data (Fig.
 1A, c, dotted line, extend methods).
 This resulted in the identification of 22 integrator neurons from 3 distinct
 imaging planes with graded levels of persistence (Sup Fig.
 1A, B).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following functional identification of neural integrator neurons, the tissue
 was fixed, stained, sectioned for serial electron microscopy and imaged
 at a final resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times5\times45$
\end_inset

 nm (RC, ML, DV) .
 These images were montaged and aligned to create a 3D electron microscopy
 volume (EM) (Fig.
 1B and Methods).
 The resulting EM volume extended ventrally from the Mauthner cell axon
 plane by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim60\mu m$
\end_inset

, caudally from the border of rhombomere 5/6 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim200\mu m$
\end_inset

 and laterally from the midline by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100\mu m$
\end_inset

.
 The LM and EM volumes were registered to each other by an affine transform,
 producing correspondence of labeled neurons and blood vessels (Fig.
 1C, Methods).
 The soma of all 22 integrator neurons from the LM volume were located in
 the EM volume within the rhombomeres 6,7 and 8 (Fig 1D, colored by time
 constants).

\begin_layout Subsection
Stripe shaped patterning of somata in the hindbrain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cell bodies in the hindbrain of the larval zebrafish follow a stereotypic
 stripe like pattern of alternating cell bodies and neuropil.
 Cells within the same stripe typically share the same neurotransmitter
 identity, and morphology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Higashijima:2004cn,Kinkhabwala:2011et,Koyama:2011kl"

\end_inset

.
 To extract this stripe like organization, we projected the locations of
 all cell somata (Fig.
 1D, 'o' symbol) from the high-resolution imaged area onto a single plane.
 The high-res EM volume contained a total of 2967 somata spread over rhombomeres
 5 through 8 (Fig.
 1D).
 The volume also contained well-known landmarks like the Mauthner neuron
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the axon of the contralateral Mauthner neuron, neurons MiD2 and MiD3 of
 the reticulo-spinal network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, and a number of commissural bundles (Fig.
 1D).
 This procedure revealed an alternating pattern of cell somata and neuropil.
 We were able to locate 3 peaks of cell somata, excluding a peak that correspond
s to neurons at the midline, each corresponding to a likely stripe (Fig.
 1D, bottom panel, S1-3).
 The three stripes were labeled based on their proximity to the midline,
 as medial (S1), intermediate (S2) and lateral stripe (S3) respectively.
 The medial most stripe S1 aligns with a group of neurons that express the

\begin_layout Subsection
Anatomical properties of integrator neurons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the identification of the integrator neurons in the EM volume, we
 reconstructed all 22 integrator neurons and annotated the pre- and postsynaptic
 locations for these neurons.
 We first characterized some of the anatomical properties that were common
 to all integrator neurons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Somata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The somatic locations of the 22 integrator neurons were distributed over
 ~23 µm in the dorsoventral axis and along the entire rostrocaudal extent
 of the imaged volume.
 A subset of these neurons was located very close to the midline and at
 the rostral edge of the imaged volume, very close to the border of rhombomeres
 6,7 and at the caudal end of the imaged volume, located in rhombomere 8,
 roughly between myotomes 1, 2.
 Another subset of neurons was located at the lateral end of the volume
 in rhombomere 8.
 The diameters of the integrator neurons were normally distributed, with
 a mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.5\pm0.6\mu m$
\end_inset

 (mean ± standard deviation).
 In general, the size of the somata was proportional to the persistence
 level of the neurons, with larger neurons exhibiting higher degree of persisten
ce (Sup.
 Fig.
 1C, Pearson coefficient = 0.4, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

= 0.059).
 On average 
\begin_inset Formula $3.3\pm1.5$
\end_inset

 neurites emerged from the somata, and traveled ventrally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Synapses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We annotated 406 presynaptic (green circles, Fig.
 2) and 2229 postsynaptic sites (red circles, Fig.
 2) on the 22 integrator neurons.
 Synapses were identified by the presence of a presynaptic vesicle pool
 and an opposing postsynaptic density.
 Synapses from or onto integrator neurons contained small vesicles, presumably
 containing a conventional neurotransmitter.
 Elsewhere in the volume we did identify synapses with dense core vesicles,
 presumably containing a peptide neurotransmitter (Sup.
 Fig.
 2A).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Integrator presynaptic sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presynaptic site was generally at a varicosity in the axon with vesicles
 throughout.
 Opposing the postsynaptic density, a small, denser cluster of vesicles
 was typically observed, along with the presynaptic density.
 These features are consistent with the idea of a presynaptic active zone.
 The number of presynaptic sites on a neuron averaged 
\begin_inset Formula $58\pm44.39$
\end_inset

.
 This is an underestimate of the number of output synapses from an integrator
 neuron, because most axonal arbors were cut off by the borders of the volume.
 If statistics are restricted to the 3 neurons that were more complete than
 others, there were 
\begin_inset Formula $156\pm47.46$
\end_inset

 postsynaptic sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Integrator postsynaptic sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The postsynaptic densities were observed as a darkening of the membrane,
 indicative of more electron dense regions, corresponding to more protein
 density.
 The number of postsynaptic sites on a neuron averaged 
\begin_inset Formula $101\pm74$
\end_inset

.
 This is a reasonable estimate of the number of input synapses to an integrator
 neuron, because most dendritic arbors were reconstructed in their entirety.
 If statistics are restricted to the 3 neurons that were more complete than
 others, there were 
\begin_inset Formula $97\pm38$
\end_inset

 presynaptic sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cell Junctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along the somatic membrane, a darkening of the membrane interrupted by small
 gaps was often observed (Sup.
 Fig.
 2B).
 The darkening persisted over multiple serial sections, suggesting that
 it was not an artifact of tissue preparation or imaging.
 These darkenings were visible between somata of integrator-integrator and
 integrator-non-integrator neurons.
 We speculate that these darkenings are some kind of cell junction.
 Gap junctions are known to exist in the developing larval zebrafish hindbrain

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dendrites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dendrites were defined by the absence of presynaptic vesicles and the presence
 of postsynaptic densities.
 They were mostly oriented ventral to the location of the somata.
 Dendrites were smooth rather than spiny.
 Some dendrites exited the imaged volume, leading to incompletely reconstructed
 neurons, where as for neurons with small dendritic arbors were completely
 reconstructed and did not have any dendrites that exited the imaged volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Axons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined axons as neurites with a) presynaptic vesicles or b) for cases
 where there were no presynaptic vesicles, define them as putative axons
 using additional anatomical cues (addressed below).
 Regions of transition, from dendrite to axon, we termed axon initiation
 sites.
 Example axon initiation sites are indicated in Fig.
 2, showing the dendrite (neurite with red postsynaptic sites) turning into
 axons at the axon initiation (open arrow) .
 The main trunk of the axon extended rostrally and ventrally (Fig.
 2 A, B, C).
 From the main trunk emerged mediolateral branches, which we will term collatera
ls.
 Those at the rostral extreme of the volume appeared to overlap with the
 expected location of the abducens motor nucleus (based on its known position
 within rhombomere r5, 6 Sup.
 Fig.
 3A ), with terminations in r4 as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed sheaths around some axonal segments.
 In some locations, we saw that the sheath wrapped around the axon a few
 times, loosely enough that cytoplasmic space was visible (Fig.
 2A, EM panel).
 This was consistent with the definition of loose myelin 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Caley:1974fk"

\end_inset

.
 This is different from the more conventionally observed compact myelin
 which appears as dark as seen elsewhere in the volume.
 The axon of the neuron in Fig.
 2A was intermittently loosely myelinated along its rostrocaudal section.
 Mediolateral collaterals emerged from the gaps in loose myelin, and remained
 unmyelinated.
 Such loose myelin sheaths have been previously reported in goldfish 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Rosenbluth:1961gl"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 10/22 (45%) integrator neurons the presence of a contralaterally projecting
 putative axon was identified.
 Because neurites in the contralateral hindbrain were not reconstructed,
 we relied on several other features for axon determination.
 First the putative axons were devoid of any postsynaptic sites on the ipsilater
al side (Fig.
 2D soma to axon initiation site, open arrow).
 The lack of postsynaptic sites on these putative axons is similar to the
 initial segment of conventional axons that were identified by the presence
 of vesicles, where no presynaptic terminals in the proximal part of the
 axon were observed, and presynaptic sites emerged only distally (Fig.
 2B, initial segment of axon).
 Secondly, before crossing the midline, the putative axon became engulfed
 by processes that appeared glial in nature (Fig.
 2 C, D, EM inset G).
 The glial engulfment is consistent with the idea of `glial bridges` that
 are instrumental in the guidance of axons during development 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Barresi:2005iw"

\end_inset

.
 Thirdly, these putative axons were thinner than the remaining neurites
 of the neuron.
 The diameter of these putative axons were smaller to the other neurites
 and were similar to the diameters of conventional axons (Sup.
 Fig.
 1C).
 The mean axonal diameter was less than the mean dendrite diameter, conforming
 to the textbook notion that axons are thinner than dendrites.
 These features were applied to determine a neurite to be a putative axon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Small protuberances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small fraction (3% or 89/2229) of the postsynaptic sites were located
 on finger-like projections from dendrites that were enveloped by invaginations
 of axonal boutons (Fig.
 2B, EM panel 2).
 These projections resemble structures found across multiple species called
 
\emph on
spinules

, and are thought to be present on large, active synapses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also observed a primary cilia on all 22 integrator neurons that were
 reconstructed.
 Primary cilium are know to be present in most, if not all mammalian cells,
 including neurons, and are though to be important for normal development
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The average cilium was typically 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim4\mu m$
\end_inset

 , is enriched with microtubules, and emerges from the neuron somata very
 close to the Golgi complex.
 In some cases, this primary cilium terminated inside processes that resembled
 glial like structures (Sup.
 Fig.
 4A).
 Orientation of primary cilium in integrator neurons did not show any orientatio
n preference (Sup.
 Fig.
 4B)

\begin_layout Section
Axonal projection patterns of integrator neurons

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstructed integrator neurons were then divided into four groups
 based on the spatial projection patterns of the axons that were identified.
 Below we have detailed the properties of integrator neurons from each of
 these four groups.

 The axons were oriented along the rostro-caudal (RC) axis with the rostral

 The average length of axons was

 Two of the six axons had projections that near the site of the abducens

 The axon initiation site was on average located

 Finally, no ipsi-only axons were observed emerging directly from the somata.
 Instead, dendrites bearing postsynaptic sites turned into axons with presynapti

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neurons in this group had large dendritic arbors, with the dendrites arborizing
 over 13.3% of the total imaged volume (Sup.
 Fig.

 The dendrites emerged laterally from somata and always extended ventrally.
 Only in one case the dendrites were observed to cross the midline, as indicated
 by the presence of postsynaptic sites (Fig.

 The average diameter of dendrites was significantly larger as compared
 to the diameter of the axons (Fig.

 The ipsilaterally projecting axons resembled the axons of the ipsi-only

 Both neurons contained another neurite crossed the midline.
 We infer that this neurite is a putative contralaterally projecting axon.
 This cannot be confirmed with certainty, because its presynaptic sites
 are on the contralateral side of the hindbrain, outside the imaged volume.
 Our inference is based on a number of cues as mentioned previously.
 In both cases, the midline cross-over happened at locations that were ventral
 to the neurons somata.

 - Eight neurons located at the caudal end of the imaged volume contained
 exclusively contralaterally projecting putative axons (Fig.
 3A, Contra only).
 Like the axons in the ipsi-only group, the putative contralateral axons
 did not emerge as axons, but started as a neurite with postsynaptic sites,
 that became axonal.
 However, unlike the ipsi-only group, the axon initiation site was much
 closer to the somata.
 On average, the axon initiation site was located 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim13\mu m$

 - The last seven neurons were located at the lateral most extent of the

 For these neurons we did not find any neurites with presynaptic sites nor
 could we locate a putative axon (Fig.

 We believe this is most likely because these neurons were not fully represented
 in the imaged volume and neurites of these neurons exit the volume before
 the axon was located.

 The axons from the ipsi-only and ipsi-contra groups had approximately 56

 We then computed the pathlength of each synaptic location from the somata
 to determine if there were differences in the distributions of the synaptic
 locations for each of the groups (Fig.
 3C, bottom histograms).
 This processes revealed that the distribution of the presynaptic sites
 along the axons among the two groups (`ipsi-only' and `ipsi-contra') were
 not different (

We further computed the synaptic density, the number of synapses per unit

 The uniformity assumption was made because the distributions of the locations
 of postsynapses was found to closely match the location of dendritic arbors
 (Sup.

 We found the there were

Planar organization of dendrites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dendrites of the neurons from the ipsi-only and contra-only groups were
 observed to lie along orthogonal planes.
 The dendrites of the neurons in the ipsi-only group were noticed to lie
 roughly along a coronal plane with some tilt (Fig.
 3A).
 Similarly, the dendrites of the neurons in the contra neurons were noticed
 to exhibit some planar organization as well.
 Fitting a plane through the postsynaptic sites that lie along the dendrites
 of the neurons in these groups revealed that these planes were nearly orthogona
l (
\begin_inset Formula $81.34^{\circ}$
\end_inset

) to each other (Fig.
 4A).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dendritic arbors of the neurons in these two groups displayed an inversion
 in the stratification depths.
 The dendritic arbors of the ipsi-only neurons peaked at a depth of 
\begin_inset Formula $38.9\pm8.3\mu m$
\end_inset

 ventral to its neurons somata (Fig.
 4B, top).
 Whereas for the contra-only group the peak stratification depth was around
 
\begin_inset Formula $12.4\pm8.8\mu m$
\end_inset

 ventral to its somata (Fig.
 4B, bottom).
 Interestingly, when we overlaid the stripe patterns computed previously
 (Fig.
 1D) with the stratification profiles of the dendrites along the medio-lateral
 axis, we see that the dendrites and axons of the ipsi-only group projected
 arbors that overlapped with neurons along the medial (S1) and lateral (S3)
 most stripes, whereas the dendrites of the contra group were located very
 close the intermediate stripe (S2) of somata.
 Similar loose organization was observed for the other group of neurons
 (Sup.
 Fig.
 6B).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Connectivity between integrator neurons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also examined the patterns of connectivity between integrator neurons.
 We found that there exists varying amounts of overlap of the axons of the
 ipsilaterally projecting neurons (Sup.
 Fig.
 6C) with the dendrites of all other neurons in the volume.
 More specifically, the overlap at ventro-rostral locations were from axons
 of ipsi-only neurons onto dendrites of other ipsi-only neurons (Sup.
 Fig.
 6C, D Ipsi–>Contra).
 Whereas, the overlap at dorso-caudal locations were from axons of ipsi-only
 neurons onto dendrites of contra-only and unknown group of neurons (Sup.
 Fig.
 6C, D).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we found that one neuron of the ipsi-only group made 2 synapses
 onto another ipsi-only neuron and 1 synapse each onto two contra-only neurons
 (Fig.
 4C).

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We combined two-photon calcium imaging from neurons in the larval zebrafish
 that were encoding for a behavioral variable (eye-position) with serial
 section electron microscopy.
 This was followed by registering the light microscopic volume to the electron
 microscopic volume to locate the same neurons.
 We were able to reconstruct 22 integrator neurons from the same animal,
 for which we had both functional and structural information.
 This procedure revealed the existence of distinct groups of neurons that
 make up the ipsilateral integrator circuit.
 This included an excitatory, ipsilaterally projecting group, an inhibitory,
 contralaterally projecting group and, a third, ipsilateral and contralaterally
 projecting group.
 Finally we provide the first conclusive evidence for synapses between integrato
r neurons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 22 integrator neurons, six, rostrally located neurons had exclusively
 ipsilaterally projecting axons.
 
\color red
Two of the six neurons were found to have more than one axon (Fig.
 2A, open arrow), and evidence of neurons with two axon is rare and has
 been reported in mammals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gobel:1975wm,Meyer:1982vy"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, it migh be possible that the secondary axon could be a false
 posive and infact an axon from a neighboring neuron.
 It is possible that this may occur due to the fact that axons are extremely
 thin, and when traveling oblique to the plane of imaging, they can appear
 to be fused.
 Removing these secondary axons did not impact the results in any way.

\color inherit
 All but one of these six neurons were medial to the first somata stripe
 S1, that is thought to contain mostly excitatory, glutamatergic neurons.
 The axons and dendrites of these neurons display a planar organization,
 with axons oriented approximately orthogonal to the dendrites (Sup.
 Fig.
 6D).
 The majority of input synapses onto the dendrites of these neurons lie
 along a plane approximately normal to the rostro-caudal (RC) axis.
 This suggests that these neurons are setup to broadly sample from axons
 that are oriented along the RC axis.
 The axons of these neurons are oriented along the RC axis with the rostral
 end more ventral than the caudal end.
 This suggests that axons from this group can potentially synpase on dendrites
 from this group.
 It has long been theorized that positive feedback via recurrent excitation
 could be a possible mechanism that can explain long persistent time scales
 of neuronal activity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Seung:2000kl,fisher_modeling_2013,Joshua:2013jg"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, we observed conclusive chemical synapses from one ipsilataterally
 projecting integrator neuron onto another ipsilaterally projecting integrator
 neuron.
 These facts point to the ipsi group of neurons as a candidate that could
 support recurrent positive feedback in the integrator circuit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second major group of neurons that we reconstructed were the eight caudally
 located, contralaterally projecting group of neurons.
 The somatic location of these neurons lie very close to the intermediate
 somal stripe S2, that are largely GABAergic neurons.
 The dendrites of these neurons arborized over a smaller area, and stratify
 more dorsally as compared to the ipsi-only group of neurons.
 The postsynaptic inputs on the dendrites of these cells lie along a plane
 that is approximately parallel to the RC plane.
 This suggests that these neurons sample narrowly from inputs along the
 RC axis.
 In the goldfish oculomotor integrator, contralaterally projecting neurons
 are thought to be involved in coordinating activity between the two sides,
 and that each side acts as an independent integrator

key "Aksay:2007cv,debowy_encoding_2011"

 Although, we have not reconstructed the contralateral side of the axons,
 evidence from light microscopic images of contralaterally projecting neurons
 shows projections that terminate in the dendritic field of the opposing
 population of inhibitory integrator neurons

\begin_layout Standard
Of the remaining integrator neurons, two were found to have both an ipsilateral
 and contralaterally projecting axon.
 The location of their somata corresponds with S2, which can be inferred
 as GABAergic however a small subset of neurons in this stripe have been
 reported as glycinergic.
 The remaining integrator neurons were located at the lateral edge of the
 animal corresponding with to the lateral most stripe S3, that are though
 to express glutamate.
 The axonal projections of these neurons exited the imaged volume, but morpholog
ical reconstructions of neurons belonging to this stripe using light microscopy
 were shown to have both ipsilateral and contralateral projections 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kinkhabwala:2011et"

\end_inset

.
 The role of these neurons remains unknown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our evidence suggest that at least two of the groups, the ipsilaterally
 projecting and the contralaterally projecting neurons are unique populations.
 They have significantly different dendritic morphologies, axonal projections
 and distributions of postsynapses along their dendrites.
 The ipsi-only group of neurons has approximately twice as many postsynaptic
 input sites as the contra-only only group.
 In both cases initiation of the axons was from a neurite that contained
 postsynaptic sites that then gave rise to presynaptic sites.
 This feature could be important to influence the activity of neurons as
 these locations are proximal to the somata.
 Finally we note that distinguishing axons from dendrites using light microscopy
 can prove erroneous, since the diameters of the axons and dendrites were
 very similar and close to the diffraction limit of light.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our sample of 22 reconstructed integrator neurons is a fraction of the roughly
 100 integrator neurons estimated to exist on one side of the larval zebrafish
 brain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We observed 4 chemical synapses from one ipsilaterally projecting integrator
 neuron onto other integrator neurons.
 This observation may be an underestimate of integrator connectivity, for
 a few reasons.
 First, there are many neurons in the imaged volume that carried no usable
 calcium signal at all, largely because they did not take up enough calcium
 indicator.
 Some of these neurons are likely to be integrator neurons overlooked by
 our study, and are potential postsynaptic partners of the reconstructed
 neurons in our sample.
 Second, there are integrator neurons outside the imaged volume, and they
 could receive synapses from our reconstructed integrator neurons.
 Only three axonal arbors were fully or mostly reconstructed; the rest appeared
 substantially cut off as their axons left the volume, this is also evidenced
 by the fact that only two of eight ipsilaterally projecting axons project
 to the abducens motor nuclei, contrary to dye fill experiments, where all
 ipsilateral axons project to the abducens.
 Third, we had no possibility of finding connections between neurons on
 opposite sides of the brain, because only one side of the brain was imaged.
 Therefore, it is difficult to know whether the single neuron that made
 synapses onto other integrator neurons is an exceptional case, or a representat
ive of a larger population that was incompletely sampled.
 More definitive information about connectivity patterns between integrator
 neurons awaits a future experiment with an imaged volume that is large
 enough to encompass all integrator neurons, and a fluorescent calcium indicator
 that labels a higher percentage of integrator neurons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we presented ultrastructural anatomical details of different types
 of integrator neurons and evidence of synaptic connectivity between these
 neurons.
 Although we restricted our reconstructions to the unilateral integrator
 circuit and consequently do not know about the postsynaptic targets of
 the contralaterally projecting axons, this approach can be used to uncover
 general rules of connectivity and validate hypothesized theories of temporal
 integration.

 postsynaptic sites along the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axis.
 Dotted line represent the location of the somatic peaks that was computed
 in Figure 1.

(C) Three views of synaptically connected integrator neurons.
 All synapses were from one neuron (magenta, arrow) from the ipsi-only group
 onto one other neuron from ipsi-only group (olive) and one synapse each
 onto two contra-only neurons (red and brown).
 Black dots represent the location of the synapses, with insets showing
 the electron micrograph at the respective location.
