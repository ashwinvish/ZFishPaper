We thank the reviewers for their comments and have tried best to address
 their concerns.
 We are encouraged by the comments of the reviewers, indeed reviewer#1 though
 that our study 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 shows, beautifully, how one can go from neuronal function in an intact
 zebrafish larva to detailed structure and connectivity in the brain''.
 It is for precisely this reason that we feel our study will be useful to
 the broader neuroscience community.

\begin_layout Standard
Reviewer 2 expressed concerns regarding (1) the lack of comparison between
 integrator neuron time constants and morphologies, (2) potential ambiguity
 in the correspondence between our anatomically defined 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stripe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of somata and the 
\emph on
alx
\emph default
-expressing stripe defined by Kinkhabwala et al., and (3) the lack of reconstruct
ion of abducens neurons.
 To address concern (1) we have added further statistical analyses to Supplement
ary Fig.
 1 (see also Discussion, line number 288).
 In brief, the time constants of contralaterally projecting neurons are
 significantly different from those of the unknown projecting group of neurons.
 We also found that neural time constant is weakly correlated with mediolateral
 somatic location, though the correlation is not quite statistically significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding concern (2), Reviewer 2 was worried that our anatomically defined
 stripe of somata might correspond with the 
\emph on
engrailed-1
\emph default
 stripe, which could potentially be confused with the 
\emph on
alx
\emph default
 stripe.
 The potential for confusion indeed exists above the level of the Mauthner
 axon, where both stripes are next to each other.
 However, our study was conducted below the level of the Mauthner axon,
 where the 
\emph on
engrailed-1
\emph default
 stripe is virtually nonexistent (see Supplementary Fig.
 3, location of somata).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In concern (3) Reviewer 2 suggested the great idea of reconstructing abducens
 neurons that are postsynaptic to integrator neurons.
 This is interesting, and we would do it if we could.
 Indeed, it would be possible for us to reconstruct postsynaptic neurons,
 but the reconstructions would be fragmentary because the neurons are at
 the ventral most extreme of the imaged volume.
 Therefore it would not be possible to conclusively identify whether reconstruct
ed postsynaptic neurons are actually abducens neurons.
 For this reason, we did not reconstruct these neurons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we have performed statistical analyses to correlate integrator
 neuron properties with their morphologies.
 We feel strongly that the inferred neurotransmitter identities as reported
 are accurate and that any further reconstructions would not lead to a more
 complete understanding of the circuit.
 More detailed answers to reviewer comments follow below.

Registration of EM-LM volumes (Fig.
 1C): How do the authors assess that the functionally imaged cells are successfu
lly re-identified in the EM volume? Fig.1C shows the correspondence between
 LM and EM images, but it would be more convincing if they showed an example
 plane where the functional calcium imaging was performed and integrator
 neurons were identified (as in Fig 1A).

We thank the reviewer for the comments.
 We agree with the reviewers' comments that it will be convincing if we
 were able to show an example plane where the functional imaging was performed
 along with the corresponding EM plane.
 To address this concern, we have added a panel showing integrator neurons
 from two functionally imaged planes and the same neurons from registered
 EM planes in Supplementary Fig.
 1C.

What is missing throughout the paper is the comparison with integrator property
 and their ultrastructural morphologies.
 They have measured time constants of the integrator neurons, but these
 metrics are not correlated with morphology.

We thank the reviewer for the comments.
 We performed statistical analyses to compared the distribution of integrator
 time constants between the three morphological groups.
 We noticed that the 'Contra' and 'Unknown' projecting groups of neurons
 had statistically different time constants.
 The remaining distributions do not show any statistically significant differenc
es.
 We added an extra panel to Supplementary figure 1 ( Sup.
 Fig.
 1D, box plot of time constants) and have commented in the main text .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\lang american
We also now report correlation coefficients between integrator time constant
 and the somatic locations alongside the figures (Sup.
 Fig.
 1).
 This analysis revealed that there is a weak correlation between time constants
 and mediolateral somatic location, that was not statistically significant.
 The remaining correlation along the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axis
 were not too weak.
 We suspect the correlations in our study are weak due to the small sample
 size of functionally identified cells in this study.

The authors infer the neurotransmitter identity of integrator neurons based
 on soma position and the pattern of neurotransmitter markers that another
 group has shown.
 This assumption underlies one of the strongest conclusions of the paper.
 However, the correspondence of the stripes shown here with the neurotransmitter
 stripes shown previously is highly speculative.
 They define soma stripes as peaks (termed S1-3, Fig.
 1D) of cell bodies that are projected along the dorso-ventral axis in this
 volume, whereas Kinkhabwala et al.
 (2011) defined stripe organization using transcription factors and neurotransmi
tter-specific transgenic lines.
 For example, the authors state that "the medial most stripe S1 aligns with
 a group of neurons that express the alx transcription factor and are most
 often glutamatergic".
 However, S1 is also close to another, engrailed-1 positive stripe, which
 contains neurons with different properties.
 Also, previous studies reported glycinergic neurons in the hindbrain, but
 the authors do not discuss this possibility.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\lang american
The 
\emph on
engrailed-1
\emph default
 stripe which contains glycinergic neurons is very close to the 
\emph on
alx
\emph default
 stripe and that neurons in each of these stripes have different properties.
 The reviewer is concerned that we may have incorrectly assigned the neurotransm
itter identity to some of the cells in the medial most stripe.
 In our study, all the cells that were imaged, were below the plane of the
 Mauthner axon (MA).
 At this level the 
\emph on
engrailed -1
\emph default
/glycinergic neurons are virtually not present, which is consistent with
 the fact that Lee M.M.
 et al., did not observe any glycinergic integrator neurons below the level
 of the MA.
 Regarding the presence of glycinergic neurons in the hindbrain, Lee M M
 et al., found that only 2% of all integrator neurons were glycinergic, and
 that the vast majority were glutamatergic or GABAergic.
 For these reasons, we feel confident that the cells that were imaged here
 would not have contained potential integrator neurons that were glycinergic.
 We have clarified the above points in the main text as well (line number
 87).

The abducens motor nucleus is the target of integrator neurons in goldfish
 and zebrafish.
 Fig.
 S3 shows that axons of some integrator neurons project near the abducens
 nerve, but the authors do not show that the axons make direct synapses
 with abducens neurons.
 This is a missed opportunity.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\lang american
As the reviewer has noted, the abducens motor nucleus is the target of integrato
r neurons.
 In the main text we had mentioned that only 2 of the 6 axons from ipsilaterally
 projecting integrator neurons projected close to the abducens.
 Although there are direct synapses made onto other neurons in that area,
 to determine if the postsynaptic target neurons are indeed abducens neurons,
 we would have to trace the entire cell.
 These synapses are at the ventral extent of the imaged volume, we feel
 that most if not all the neurites of these potential abducens neurons will
 be incomplete.
 This would make is impossible to determine if these neurons were indeed
 abducens neurons.
 Thus, although we would have liked to have this information, it is not
 in the scope of the imaged data of the study.

\begin_layout Enumerate

In the Discussion (third paragraph on page 7), the authors discuss that
 the most laterally located group of neurons in S3, which they speculate
 to be glutamatergic, have been shown in the previous study by Kinkhabwala
 et al.
 to have both ipsilateral and contralateral projections.
 However, such data are not shown in the Kinkhabwala et al.
 paper.

The reviewer correctly pointed to a mistake in discussion that was made
 by the authors.
 In Kinkhabwala et.
 al.
 the lateral most class of cells corresponds with the 
\emph on

 The morphology of these cells, their axonal projections are yet to be determine
